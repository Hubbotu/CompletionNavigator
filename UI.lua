-- Completion Navigator :: minimap button, main window, and tab framework.
--
-- Every command in this addon is reachable by clicking. Typing is the
-- power-user path, not the required path.
--
-- Tabs are registered, not hardcoded, so a module can contribute its own
-- panel without this file knowing it exists:
--
--   CN.UI.RegisterTab{
--       name    = "Pets",
--       order   = 40,
--       build   = function(content) end,   -- once, on first show
--       refresh = function(content) end,   -- every time it becomes visible
--   }
--
-- No external libraries. LibDBIcon and Ace would each drag in an embedded
-- library tree, and the minimap button below is about eighty lines.

-- Published for UI/List.lua, which draws the rows inside this chrome and has
-- to know how wide they get and how tall they are.
UI.WINDOW_WIDTH = 560

-- Published beside the width, so a layout test can compute what fits in a
-- panel the way the client does rather than hard-coding a number that goes
-- stale the next time the tab strip wraps to another row. 0.84.0.
-- TALLER, BECAUSE THE SETTINGS COLUMN DID NOT FIT AND NEITHER DID THE
-- LISTS. 0.84.0.
--
-- Eleven tabs wrap the strip to two rows, which pushes the body down to 314
-- pixels -- and the Settings tab's right column is a chain of nine
-- checkboxes, two headings and a button, about 335 deep. That is why it kept
-- overflowing: the column was never going to fit, and each fix moved the
-- collision to a different pair of controls rather than removing it.
--
-- Forty more pixels of window is also forty more of every list in it -- two
-- more rows on a tab whose whole job is showing rows -- so this is the fix
-- that makes the window better rather than merely legal.
UI.WINDOW_HEIGHT = 560

-- The tab strip's geometry, published for the same reason: the body's height
-- depends on how many rows the strip wraps to, and a layout test that
-- hard-codes the answer goes stale the next time a tab is added. 0.84.0.

-- How wide the right-aligned value column is on the rows that use one. Wide
-- enough for the longest thing any tab puts there -- the reputation row's
-- "412 account-wide, 96 this character" -- and zero on the rows that do not,
-- which is most of them.
UI.VALUE_WIDTH  = 210

-- LATE-BOUND ON PURPOSE.
--
-- The tab builders below call UI.CreateList rather than a local, because
-- UI/List.lua loads AFTER this file: a local captured here would be nil
-- forever. The first version of the split left them calling a bare
-- `CreateList`, which resolved to a global that does not exist -- every tab
-- would have failed to build in game. luacheck caught it; the harness did
-- not, because it never builds all eleven tabs.

-- to 52. With the eleven registered tabs, seven fit on the first row and the
-- last two of them -- Zone and Warband -- were drawn underneath the filter
-- box and its label, in the default configuration, on every install.
--
-- The wrap test could not have known: it measured against the window's width
-- and the search box is not a tab.
--
-- Fixed by giving each its own band rather than by making the wrap cleverer.

-- gets the line if it is open -- the click happened there, so the answer
-- belongs there -- and chat gets it if it is not, which is how the same
-- handler behaves when a slash command reaches it.
--
-- Never both: the same sentence in two places reads as two things happening.
-- HOW FAR AWAY, IN TIME THE PLAYER RECOGNISES. 0.68.0.
--
-- Two 0.67.0 tooltips printed `CN.TravelCost` as minutes. It is not minutes:
-- a cost point is `Travel.secondsPerCostPoint` seconds -- thirty -- so every
-- one of those lines reported double the addon's own estimate. And
-- `CN.TravelCost` never returns nil: on a miss it returns the pessimism
-- constant the scorer uses to rank an unknown location, so "About 40 minutes
-- away" was printed for a rare thirty yards off whenever the client had not
-- yet answered about the player's position.
--
-- A journey the addon cannot estimate is not described at all. Saying nothing
-- is the honest form of not knowing, and every other travel line in this
-- addon already works that way.
-- HOW MANY ROWS THE MAIN LIST DRAWS. Named once, because a tooltip that
-- counts over a different number than the list shows is making a promise
-- about rows that are not there. 0.68.0.

-- walk of the flight network; and it applied the confidence flag but not the
-- clamp, so a rare forty minutes away printed a confident duration in the
-- tooltip while its row in `/cn list` printed no distance at all.
