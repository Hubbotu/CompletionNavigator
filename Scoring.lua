-- `/cn order` -- and nothing in the addon has ever set either field on an
-- objective. They contributed exactly zero to every score ever computed,
-- while making the documented formula longer and the explanation of the
-- ranking less true. Removed in 0.48.0.
--
-- `estimatedTime` was in the same state, but with a difference: `/cn mode
-- fastest` advertises it as one of its two levers, so leaving it inert made
-- the mode half a feature. It now has a producer -- see the decorator below
-- -- and stays.

-- WHAT A JOURNEY THE ADDON CANNOT COST IS CHARGED.
--
-- Raised from 3 in 0.57.0, and split from "this is not anywhere" -- see
-- `CN.IsPlaceless`. At 3 it was CHEAPER than the far side of the player's own
-- zone, which costs about 3.3, so "I have no idea where this is" outranked
-- "I can see it from here" and twenty of the top thirty recommendations had
-- no coordinates on them.
--
-- `Travel.CostFor` already reasons this out for a journey it cannot compute
-- and lands on the pessimistic answer. This is the same question about the
-- same kind of ignorance, so it gets the same shape of answer: comfortably
-- above a zone crossing, comfortably below the cross-continent ceiling of 40.
CN.unknownLocationCost = 8

-- Doing something at a place you are going to anyway is cheaper than doing it

-- URGENCY.
--
-- "This is gone in six hours" is the strongest signal the game gives, and
-- until now the addon treated it as a flag rather than a gradient: a world
-- quest with four days left and one with nine minutes left scored the same.
-- That is exactly backwards at the moment it matters.
--
-- The curve is deliberately steep and late. Something with a day left is not
-- urgent -- saying so would make everything urgent, which is the same as
-- nothing being urgent. Inside two hours it climbs hard.
CN.urgencyHorizonSeconds = 7200
CN.urgencyWeight         = 4.0

-- A SECOND HORIZON, ADDED IN 0.43.0.
--
-- Two hours was the right window when everything with a deadline was a world
-- quest. It stopped being right when lockouts and the Great Vault arrived:
-- both expire at the weekly reset, so both sat at exactly zero urgency for
-- six and a half days and then jumped. A raid you are six bosses into, with
-- eighteen hours left on it, is genuinely more urgent than the same raid on
-- Wednesday -- and the curve could not say so.
--
-- So: a long ramp that starts a week out and carries a small amount of
-- weight, and the original short ramp on top of it for the last two hours.
-- The short one still dominates, which is the point -- a world quest with ten
-- minutes on it should still beat a lockout with four days.

-- thing it could get plainly wrong was ranking a deadline the player has no
-- way of meeting ABOVE the things they can actually do. A world quest with
-- eight minutes left, twelve minutes of flying away, was scored as the most
-- urgent thing in the game: the term is the heaviest in the table, and eight
-- minutes is deep into the squared part of the ramp.
--
-- The addon already holds both halves of the answer -- the journey, from the
-- travel model, and how long this kind of work takes this player, measured.
-- Using them costs nothing and removes the one row a player would point at
-- and say the list is wrong.
--
-- `secondsNeeded` is optional and the curve is unchanged without it: a caller
-- that cannot estimate the journey gets exactly the old behaviour rather than
-- a guess.

-- WHETHER THE JOURNEY WAS COSTED AT ALL, AND HOW LONG IT IS AT LEAST.
--
-- Two questions with different right answers, and 0.68.0 and 0.69.0 each
-- collapsed them into one function. The history is worth keeping because both
-- mistakes are easy to make again.
--
-- 0.68.0 added `Session.TypicalSeconds(type)` -- the median of every
-- completion of that TYPE on the account -- to the journey. A whole-type
-- median is not about this objective: campaign quests, escorts and world
-- quests share one bucket, so a "kill 8 boars" world quest thirty yards away
-- with five minutes left scored no urgency at all, below one with three days
-- on it. World quests carry no other deadline signal, so that removed all of
-- it.
--
-- 0.69.0 removed the median and returned nil whenever the cost reached
-- `Travel.maximumCost` -- and `Travel.CostFor` CLAMPS there, so every real
-- journey over twenty minutes lands on exactly 40 and became
-- indistinguishable from "I could not route this". A quest 39.9 away lost its
-- urgency and the one 40 away -- farther, and certainly unreachable -- kept
-- all of it. The rule inverted itself at the top of its own range.
--
-- It also trusted `CN.unknownLocationCost`, which is 8 and therefore under
-- the ceiling, and four providers hard-code small routing weights for things
-- that are not anywhere at all -- so `/cn list` printed "2m away" for the
-- Great Vault.
--
-- `travelCosted` settles it. Only the providers that actually asked the
-- travel model set it, so nothing else can be mistaken for a measurement.

-- HOW FAR AWAY A THING IS, IN WORDS, FOR EVERY SURFACE THAT SAYS SO. 0.72.0.
--
-- `CN.SecondsNeeded` returns nil at or above the travel model's clamp, which
-- is right for arithmetic -- twenty minutes is where the estimate stops being
-- a measurement -- and wrong as a thing to render, because both callers then
-- printed NOTHING for the farthest objectives in the list. A row with no
-- distance reads as "unknown", and the rows the player most wants warned
-- about are exactly the ones that got no warning.
--
-- The two callers also disagreed. `/cn list` went through `SecondsNeeded` and
-- honoured the clamp; `UI.DistanceLine` called `Travel.EstimateSeconds`
-- directly, honoured only the confidence flag, and cheerfully printed "About
-- 47 minutes away" for a rare whose row in the list showed no distance at
-- all. Same objective, same moment, two answers -- which is the exact defect
-- 0.71.0's "one definition of a measured journey" was written to end, still
-- standing in the two places a player actually reads.
--
-- One function now, and it answers for the far case instead of going quiet.
-- Returns the phrase, whether it is an exact figure or a floor, and -- for
-- the floor case -- the bare duration with no wording around it.
--
-- THE THIRD RETURN EXISTS BECAUSE THE SECOND CALLER WAS PARSING THE FIRST.
-- 0.73.0.
--

-- adjuster's -- was appended to one array on the objective. Four writers with
-- four different lifetimes sharing one list, and each of them had to know
-- where its own entries began and ended in order to take them back.
--
-- That produced, in three consecutive releases: sentences repeated once per
-- rebuild; sentences deleted and unrestorable because the key that said "I
-- already said this" outlived the sentence itself; a quest collecting every
-- state it had ever been in; and an unlock count frozen because a rollback
-- nilled half its bookkeeping. Every one was a different symptom of the same
-- cause -- BOUNDARY INDICES INTO A SHARED, MUTATING ARRAY.
--

--
-- Harvest and Goals both discovered this and both call `InvalidateCandidates`
-- alongside the bump. Warband, Session and the decorator registry did not, so
-- three of the five callers were bumping a counter nothing would read. The
-- registry's own header names "a decorator registering late" as the case it
-- exists for, and that case did not work.
--
-- One function, so the next caller cannot get it half right.
-- `deliberate` = the player just did this, so no cooldown may delay it.

-- Cheap enough to be worth doing before a full re-rank: one pass over one
-- provider's output, which is capped, against scoring and sorting every
-- candidate in the addon.
--
-- REWRITTEN IN 0.55.0, BECAUSE 0.54.0's VERSION WAS WRONG.
--
-- The original compared five fields and, on a match, kept the PREVIOUS tables
-- and discarded the ones the provider had just built. That is only sound if
-- the compared fields are the only ones a consumer reads. They were not, and
-- one of the five did not exist at all.
--
-- What it missed:
--
--   * `travelCost`. Providers recompute it on every build, and the scorer
--     reads it without recomputing. So a rebuild triggered by walking into a
--     new zone -- which is when travel costs change most -- was thrown away
--     precisely because the quest set had not changed. Costs were measured
--     once, at the first build, and survived the session.
--   * `expiresIn`, which drives the urgency term at the heaviest weight in
--     the table. A world quest froze the value it had when it entered its
--     current urgency bucket, so the steep last-hour ramp never fired.
--   * `mapID`, `x`, `y`. A quest whose coordinates resolve from nil to real
--     kept the nil, so the waypoint and the map pin pointed at nothing.
--   * `name`. A title the client caches a moment later stayed "Quest 84321".
--   * `phase`. PICKUP to ACTIVE changes no other compared field, so the hub
--     kept sorting by the old one.
--
-- And `urgency` is not a field. Nothing in the addon has ever written one:
-- the comparison was `nil ~= nil`, a dead clause standing exactly where
-- `expiresIn` should have been.
--
-- So: compare everything the scorer, the router and the display actually
-- read. That is a longer list and it means the shortcut fires less often --
-- notably not at all while the player is moving, which is the honest answer,
-- because that is exactly when the re-score is needed.
--
-- The optimisation still earns its place. Standing still with the window
-- open, which is the case it was written for, every volatile provider still
-- short-circuits.
-- WHAT THE PROVIDER SAID, AND NOTHING ELSE.
--
-- `unlockValue` and `hubSize` were in this list and are written by a
-- DECORATOR and by `BuildZoneRoute` respectively -- after the build, onto the
-- objects in the previous list. The fresh list therefore always had nil where
-- the previous one had a number, every comparison failed, and the reuse
-- shortcut could never fire for any provider whose rows had been routed or
-- carried an unlock count. The optimisation was present, documented, measured
-- -- and off, which is this project's most repeated defect.
--
-- Both are RESTORED by the reuse rather than lost by it: reusing the previous
-- table keeps the decoration that is already on it, which is the whole point.

    -- Both are multiplicative on the whole score rather than additive terms,
    -- so they are shown as what they are: a line saying what the running
    -- total was multiplied by, and by how much it moved the number.
