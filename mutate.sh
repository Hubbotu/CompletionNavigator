# mutate.sh -- does the test suite actually test anything?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# A passing suite proves the code runs. It does not prove the assertions
# would notice if the code were wrong, and this project has repeatedly found
# tests that would not: an assertion comparing a value against the setting
# that produced it, a fixture that failed a different check first, a
# comparison so loose that east reading as west still passed.
#
# Every one of those was found by hand, by breaking the code on purpose and
# seeing whether anything complained. That is a mechanical task and it was
# being done from memory, which means it was being done inconsistently.
#
# Each mutation below is a deliberate, plausible bug. A mutation that SURVIVES
# is a hole in the suite, and the correct response is to write the missing
# assertion -- never to delete the mutation.
#

# A BACKTICK IN AN ANCHOR IS A COMMAND, NOT A CHARACTER. 0.77.0.

# in backticks everywhere. A 0.77.0 anchor copied a comment line verbatim,
# the shell tried to run `EffectiveWeights`, and the mutation silently became

# NOT a mutation, and here is why, because the absence of one is a decision.
#
# 0.59.0 split the pruning bound: the early exit now uses a floor that is
# MONOTONE in `walkOut` -- the continent-wide minimum outgoing edge rather
# than the origin's own -- and the per-origin floor became an exact filter.
# The obvious mutation is to put `minOutgoing[i]` back into the break.
#
# It survives, and it survives honestly. Reaching a case where it changes the
# answer requires a later origin whose floor is lower, i.e. a saving of
# `m / flightSpeed` exceeding an extra walk of `d / runSpeed` -- so
# `m > 3.6 * d`. But `m` is bounded by the distance from that origin to its
# nearest node, and the triangle inequality bounds THAT by `d` plus the later
# origin's own minimum. The two constraints cannot both hold. An independent
# search over five and a half thousand randomised continents found no case
# either.
#
# So the unsound break was almost certainly harmless. It was still changed,
# because "almost certainly" is not an argument you can check, the correct
# version is two lines, and it measured FASTER. Same shape as the math.fmod
# note above: a mutation that cannot be killed because it is not a defect
# does not belong in this file.
