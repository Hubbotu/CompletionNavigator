-- PROFESSION KNOWLEDGE
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Weekly knowledge is the most permanently missable thing in modern
-- professions: the cap resets, and a week not collected is gone. The client
-- exposes it as a currency, which is why this reads currencies rather than
-- the profession API -- fewer moving parts, and it works for every expansion
-- that has used the pattern.
--
-- THE ENGLISH WORD WAS THE GATE, AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN. FIXED 0.61.0.
--
-- `knowledgePattern = "[Kk]nowledge"` was matched against the currency's
-- LOCALIZED name. On a German client the currency is "Wissen", on French
-- "Connaissance", on Spanish "Conocimiento" -- so this section, and every
-- candidate it produces, returned exactly zero rows on every non-English
-- client in the world. That is roughly half the player base being silently
-- denied the feature this file's own header calls "the most permanently
-- missable thing in modern professions".
--
-- It is also the second locale bug of this shape the project has found, and
-- the lesson is the same: a localized string is a thing to DISPLAY, never a
-- thing to BRANCH ON.
--
-- What replaces it is a fact the client vouches for in every locale: the
-- currency has a weekly cap and there is room left under it. That is already
-- what the loop below tests, and it was the honest gate all along. A weekly
-- cap on a currency is the game saying "this is gone on Tuesday", which is
-- precisely the question `/cn clock` asks.
--
-- AND THE DEMOTED PATTERN IS GONE TOO. 0.63.0.
--
-- 0.61.0 kept it as an ordering hint, which is the same bug with a smaller
-- blast radius: an English player saw knowledge sorted first and a German
-- player did not. A hint that works in one language is not a hint. See the
-- note at the ordering below for what replaced it.

-- Locale-free reinforcement: the profession knowledge currencies the addon
-- knows by id. An id is the same in every locale. This is a HINT for
-- ordering, not a gate -- a currency missing from this list is still
-- reported, because the weekly cap is what makes it missable and a hard-coded
-- list of ids goes stale on every content patch.

-- ASKING FOR THE KEYSTONE

-- ON EVERY LOADING SCREEN, not once at login. A keystone changes when one is
-- used and again at the weekly reset, and the latch inside
-- `RequestKeystoneInfo` exists so that reading the keystone is not a server
-- round trip every time -- not so that the addon asks once and never again.
--
-- The same pair `Modules/Instances.lua` uses for the lockout list, one
-- release later, on the system that fix did not sweep for.
