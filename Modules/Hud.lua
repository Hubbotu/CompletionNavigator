-- Modules/Hud.lua
-- Completion Navigator :: a small always-on frame, and the settings that make
-- the whole addon legible.
--
-- THE HUD.
--
-- Off by default, like everything in this addon that puts pixels on the
-- screen uninvited. It shows one line -- what to do next -- and nothing else,
-- because a heads-up display that needs reading is not a heads-up display.
--
-- Distinct from Follow's frame, which appears only while a route is being
-- walked and shows the current stop. This is for the player who is not
-- following anything and wants the answer visible while they get on with
-- something else.
--
-- ACCESSIBILITY.
--
-- Two settings that cost almost nothing and matter a great deal to the people
-- who need them:
--
--   * A scale, because the default font is small and not everybody's monitor
--     is two feet away.
--   * A colourblind mode for the navigation arrow. The arrow's whole language
--     is colour -- blue on course, amber drifting, red walking away -- which
--     is exactly the design that fails eight percent of men. In this mode the
--     arrow carries a short text label as well, so the information survives
--     the colour being indistinguishable.
--
-- The rule behind both: no information carried by colour alone.

------------------------------------------------------------

-- Named `Preferences`, not `Settings`.
--
-- `Settings` is also the name of the client's global options API since 10.0,
-- and this file's options-panel registration reads `Settings.RegisterCanvas-
-- LayoutCategory` -- which resolved to this local FUNCTION and threw
-- "attempt to index a function value" on every login on every retail client.
-- The error was caught and printed, and because it aborted the function the
-- pre-10.0 fallback below never ran either: the addon has never appeared in
-- the game's own options list, which is the entire purpose of that block.
--
-- The harness never defined SettingsPanel, so the `and` chain short-circuited
-- before the bad index and the suite saw nothing. Same shape as the invented
-- event name: a stub more forgiving than the client.
