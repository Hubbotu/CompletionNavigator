-- flight, and the handler below clears the pending flag on EVERY answer --
-- including `success = false`, and including a success that carries no title.
-- Both are ordinary answers from the client, and both put the id straight
-- back into the "not asked" state, so the next rebuild asked again, two
-- seconds later, for ever.
--
-- The latch 1.6.0 added therefore closed only the case where no answer ever
-- arrives, which is the one the test fixture happened to model. The two the
-- client actually produces were untouched, and the suite's own request budget
-- passed because the stub answered nothing rather than answering "no".
--
-- A separate table rather than a third value in `pendingQuestLoads`, because
-- that table is tested for truthiness in three places and a `false` in it
-- reads as "not pending" at every one of them.

-- described behaviour that did not exist, which is worse than the missing

-- METADATA
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Writes a name only when the incoming source is at least as
-- authoritative as the stored one. Manual entries never clobber Blizzard.
-- A ROW IS A STRING UNLESS IT HAS SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY. 0.61.0.
--
-- `questMetadata` is the largest store in the addon: 708 KB of a 2.0 MB
-- SavedVariables file, and the game rewrites that file in full on every
-- logout. Every row was a two-field TABLE -- `{ name = ..., source = ... }`
-- -- and on an established account 30,000 of them said `source = "blizzard"`,
-- which is the default and carries no information.
--
-- The name itself does have to be kept. `GetTitleForQuestID` answers only for
-- quests the CLIENT has cached, and returns nil with an async request for
-- everything else -- so without this store the addon shows "Quest 84213" for
-- anything the player has not looked at this session. That is a real thing
-- the client will not re-supply on demand, and the standing rule permits it.
--
-- What the rule does NOT permit is the wrapper. So a row is now the name
-- itself, and only a name the PLAYER typed -- which must survive being
-- offered a Blizzard one -- keeps a table to say so. That is a handful of
-- rows against thirty thousand.
--
-- Both readers below accept either shape, and migration 15 collapses the
-- existing ones on first login.
-- A BARE STRING IS THE CLIENT'S NAME, AND ONLY THE CLIENT'S. 0.63.0.
--
-- 0.61.0 collapsed the row to a bare string for everything except a name the
-- player typed, and taught this to report a bare string as source
-- "blizzard". That threw away provenance for two other sources -- a title
-- read from a gossip window ("offered") and one read from a map pin
-- ("available") -- and did something worse than lose a label: because
-- "blizzard" is rank 1, the TOP of `CN.sourceRank`, a guess captured from a
-- map pin outranked the authoritative quest-log title that arrived later, and
-- `IsBetterSource` refused to correct it. `/cn cache 12345` then reported the
-- guess as having come from the client.
--
-- The saving was never in dropping the source; it was in dropping the
-- WRAPPER for the overwhelmingly common case. So the common case keeps the
-- bare string and every other source keeps its table -- a handful of rows
-- against thirty thousand, which is the same arithmetic that justified the
-- change in the first place.
--
-- "offered" and "available" are ranked now, too. They were absent from the
-- ladder entirely, which made them rank 99: worse than anything, including
-- each other.

-- REPORTED FROM LIVE PLAY: "I'm literally standing in front of one to pick
-- up" while this returned zero. Three separate reasons that can happen, and
-- the old version was vulnerable to all three:
--
--   1. WRONG MAP. GetBestMapForUnit answers with the most specific map you
--      are standing on -- a city, a cave, a building interior. Quest starts
--      belonging to the surrounding zone are registered against the PARENT
--      map, so asking only about your own map misses them. This is the most
--      likely cause and the cheapest to fix: ask the neighbourhood.
--   2. THE MAP SIMPLY DOES NOT SAY. A giver whose pin the client has not
--      loaded is invisible to every map query. The only thing that cannot be
--      wrong is the conversation itself, so talking to an NPC now records
--      what they offered.
--
-- Sources are unioned and each result says where it came from, because when
-- this is wrong again the first question will be "which source found it".
-- `quiet` MEANS "READ, DO NOT RECORD". 0.70.0.
--
-- This writes: every quest-start pin it walks past is filed into the
-- remembered store, which is a SavedVariable, and each new one moves the
-- shortlist revision. That is right when the player is playing, and wrong
-- when something is merely reading -- `/cn find` refreshes every tab so the
-- search has rows to look at, and the Journey tab's refresh reaches here, so
-- typing a search with the window shut wrote pins to disk and forced a
-- shortlist rebuild.
