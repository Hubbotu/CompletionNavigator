-- Modules/Instances.lua
-- Completion Navigator :: dungeons and raids, which the addon could not see.
--
-- WHAT WAS MISSING.
--
-- Until now this addon knew everything about the open world and nothing about
-- the inside of a dungeon. A mount that drops from a raid boss was a line of
-- free text out of the mount journal: no boss, no instance, no difficulty, no
-- idea whether you had already killed the thing this week. `/cn chase` on such
-- a mount produced a goal with no path to it, which is the one thing this
-- addon is supposed to never do.
--
-- Worse, lockouts are the strongest deadline in the game -- stronger than a
-- daily, because a missed raid week is gone for a week rather than a day --
-- and the ranking could not see them at all, so a world quest expiring in an
-- hour outranked a raid you were six bosses into with two days left on it.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO.
--
-- It does not queue for anything, invite anyone, or set foot in an instance.
-- It reads three things and reports them: what you are locked to, which
-- bosses in that lockout are still alive, and where a given drop comes from.
--
-- AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO STORE.
--
-- Nothing. A lockout expires, the client always knows it, and a stale copy is
-- worse than none: "6 of 8 down in there" is actively wrong advice the moment
-- the reset it never heard about happens. The same goes for loot tables,
-- which change with patches. Everything here is read live and cached in
-- memory for the session at most.

-- LOCKOUTS
------------------------------------------------------------

-- An unfinished lockout is the cheapest progress in the game: the bosses you
-- already killed stay dead, so the remaining ones cost a fraction of a fresh
-- clear. A finished one is worth nothing until it resets. That difference is
-- the entire reason this module scores anything.
-- Whether the server has actually handed over the lockout list this segment.
--
-- AN UNANSWERED REQUEST AND AN EMPTY WEEK LOOK IDENTICAL. 1.5.0.
--
-- 1.2.0 found that the addon read `GetNumSavedInstances` and never called
-- `RequestRaidInfo`, and sent the request. It did not touch the other half:
-- both "the server has not answered yet" and "you are saved to nothing"
-- arrive as a count of zero, and `/cn instances` printed "You are not saved
-- to anything" for both. That is backlog rule 169 -- a guard whose empty
-- branch is also its failure branch -- and it is worst in exactly the moment
-- the request was added for, the first seconds after a login, which is when
-- somebody types this command.
--
-- 1.4.0 fixed the same shape for the inbox and did not sweep for its
-- siblings, which is rule 30 inside two releases.
--
-- `UPDATE_INSTANCE_INFO` is the client saying the list is in hand; the
-- provider eight hundred lines below has declared it since it was written.

    -- reliably returns nothing. Caching that made the emptiness permanent for
    -- the session: every later ask returned the memoised zero and the search
    -- that had by then completed was never read. So misses were not recorded
    -- at all, justified in this comment by "the cost of asking again is one
    -- search the player triggered themselves".
    --
    -- That stopped being true when the tooltip became a caller. A tooltip is
    -- not triggered by the player asking a question; it fires on every
    -- tooltip built, and MOST COLLECTIBLES ARE NOT BOSS DROPS -- so the
    -- common case was the uncached one. Sweeping a bag, a loot window or an
    -- auction-house page of mounts ran a full `EJ_SetSearch` cycle, with a
    -- save and restore of the Adventure Guide's own selection, dozens of

    --
    --   * the Adventure Guide is not on this client, or is OPEN -- in which
    --     case the search never ran. `WithJournal` refuses outright while the
    --     player has it open, and the tooltip and `/cn chase` both call in
    --     with no such guard.
    --   * `EJ_SetSearch` has not finished. The client's search is
    --     asynchronous and the FIRST query for a name reliably returns
    --     nothing -- which is the defect the comment above was written for.
    --   * the name genuinely drops from nothing.
    --
    -- So `/cn drops <name>` typed twice in a row answered "nothing in the
    -- Adventure Guide matches" for a full minute, and a raid mount's chase
    -- silently lost its "kill this boss" step.
    --
    -- Only the third is remembered. A refusal is not written at all; a first
    -- zero is recorded as HAVING BEEN ASKED, which the read path above treats
    -- as no answer, so the next call searches again and it is the second zero
    -- that becomes a miss.

--
-- The caller knows the difficulty only sometimes, so:

--   * given a difficulty, match it exactly;
--   * otherwise prefer a lockout that is NOT complete, because an open
--     difficulty means the answer to "can I go and kill it" is yes;

-- is told to go and kill a boss they are already saved to. A failure that

-- ASKING FOR THE LOCKOUT LIST
------------------------------------------------------------

-- THE ADDON WAS LISTENING FOR AN ANSWER IT NEVER ASKED FOR. 1.2.0.
--
-- `GetNumSavedInstances` reads a table the client does not populate on its
-- own: `RequestRaidInfo()` asks the server, and the `UPDATE_INSTANCE_INFO`
-- declared eight lines above is the answer arriving. Without the request the
-- count is zero for the whole session unless the player happens to open the
-- Raid Info frame, which sends it for them -- so `/cn lockouts`, the
-- part-finished-raid candidate, the vault's dungeon row and the "Dungeons and
-- raids" section of this addon's store page were all silently empty for
-- somebody who logged in and asked what to do next.
--
-- `Providers/BlizzardWorld.lua` handles this correctly for the calendar two
-- hundred lines from `GetSavedInstances` -- `C_Calendar.OpenCalendar()`
-- before reading day events, under a header saying the calendar is
-- asynchronous. One asynchronous system got its request and its sibling did
-- not.
--
-- ON EVERY LOADING SCREEN, not once at login. A lockout belongs to a
-- character and changes when one is used; the once-per-session latch inside
-- `RequestSavedInstances` exists so that reading a lockout does not send a
-- server round trip every time, not so that the addon asks once and never
-- again.
-- ONE HANDLER, BECAUSE THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. 1.6.0.
--
-- 1.5.0 added a second `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` handler at the top of this
-- file to clear `Instances.answered`, leaving two handlers for one event
-- doing two halves of one thing. They happened to be registered in the right
-- order -- clear the answer, then re-ask -- and nothing said so, so moving
-- either block would have silently discarded an answer that arrived between
-- them. The three statements belong together and now are together.
