## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0]

**The addon knew the answer might be wrong and told only its own self-test.**

1.9.0 built a registry so every system that asks the server for something can
say whether it asked and whether it was answered. It shipped with one reader:
`/cn selftest`. So in the seconds after a loading screen the addon knew,
precisely, that the lockout list had not come back â€” and the recommendation
engine, which ranks instances by what you are saved to, went on printing a
confident headline and a Why block from data it could have said was
incomplete. A dungeon you are already saved to is a real recommendation to a
client whose lockouts have not arrived, and the addon silently changed its
mind a second later.

### Added

- **The answer says when it is provisional.** `/cn next`, the heads-up line
  and the main window now carry one sentence while a request the ranking
  depends on is outstanding: "Still hearing back about your lockouts and your
  mailbox; this may change." The answer is still shown â€” an addon that shows
  nothing for four seconds after every loading screen is worse than one that
  shows a caveat â€” it just stops claiming more than it knows. In chat and in
  the window the line goes ABOVE the answer, in the position the group notice
  already uses, because it changes how to read what follows; in the Why block
  it sits above the reasons rather than among them, since "the lockout list
  has not come back" is a statement about the whole answer and not a reason to
  do this particular thing.

- **A server request carries a player-facing token as well as a diagnostic
  label.** The labels were written for one reader in English; reusing them
  would have put untranslated nouns inside a translated sentence, and nothing
  would have complained, because `CN.L` falls back to English by design and
  the canonical-key lint only sees keys that exist. The registration now
  carries both, the two nouns are canonical keys translated into all ten
  shipped locales, and the suite asserts that every token on every
  registration is a key the addon actually declares.

- **Quest titles are deliberately not in the notice.** An outstanding title
  changes what a row is called; nothing in the ranking reads a name. Including
  them would also have made the heads-up line flip between a reason and a
  caveat every few seconds during ordinary play â€” titles go outstanding
  continuously, which is what `CN.burstInvalidationEvents` debounces
  `QUEST_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` for â€” for a caveat that was not true of the answer.
  They stay registered and stay in `/cn selftest`, which is the reader their
  count was written for.

- **The notice asks both halves of the pair.** A client that offers no way to
  send the request produces no notice, the same distinction 1.9.0 was built
  around. This is the second cross-cutting reader of that pair, which is
  exactly where the first one got it wrong, so the suite checks it here too.

## [1.9.0]

**Four copies of one pattern, and the first thing to read across them asked
the wrong question.**

Six releases found client systems this addon read and never asked for â€” the
lockout list, the keystone, the inbox, the item cache, quest titles. Each fix
grew the same four parts in a different file: a send, a once-per-segment
latch, a forget on a loading screen, and a flag saying the answer arrived.
1.8.0 then added the first thing that reads across them, and it reported
anything not *answered* rather than anything *asked and not answered*. On a
client with no `RequestRaidInfo` and no `CheckInbox` â€” where nothing was asked
and nothing can be â€” `/cn selftest` said the addon was still waiting for
replies it had never asked for and never could, permanently.

### Changed

- **The cross-cutting half of that pattern is a registry.** Each system says
  how to tell whether it has been asked and whether it has been answered;
  nothing else has to know there are four of them. The self-test that reports
  outstanding requests carried its own hardcoded list of three modules, which
  meant a fifth system would have been a fifth edit there and a fifth chance
  to get the question wrong. It is a registration now.

  The per-system halves stay where they are. Each belongs in the file that
  owns the state, and collapsing them would have moved four well-documented
  latches into one place that knows about four unrelated things.

- The keystone is still deliberately unregistered, for the reason 1.5.0 gave:
  it has no event saying its answer arrived, so it would report *asked* and
  never *answered* â€” permanently outstanding for every character that holds no
  keystone. A system with no answering signal contributes nothing here, and
  saying so beats a line that is always wrong.

### How defects were found

- **The suite swept for the shape rule 183 names**, a fixture selecting its
  subject by a property it shares rather than by one it owns. Twenty-six
  last-match-wins selectors in the harness; all but the one 1.8.0 already
  fixed pick by an exact name.

## [1.8.0]

Six releases found systems this addon read from the client and never asked
for. All four are asked for now â€” and until this release nothing said which of
them the addon was still waiting to hear back about.

### Added

- **`/cn selftest` reports what has been asked for and not answered.** A
  player who runs `/cn next` in the first seconds after a login and sees no
  raid lockout could not tell "you are saved to nothing" from "the answer has
  not landed yet" without running the one command that happens to distinguish
  them. Three of the four can say: the lockout list, the mailbox, and how many
  quest titles are outstanding. It reports waiting as a not-yet rather than as
  a failure, because waiting is the ordinary state of the first few seconds
  and an addon that reports the ordinary state as a problem teaches the player
  to ignore the command.

  The keystone is deliberately absent, for the reason 1.5.0 recorded: it has
  no event saying the answer arrived, so a "still asking" line would be
  permanently wrong for every character that holds none.

### How defects were found

- **The fixture pins added for a branch are asserted to reach that branch.**
  1.6.0 added a quest pin to exercise an untested branch, gave it an odd id,
  and this fixture's client answers "completed" for every odd id below 70000 â€”
  so it was dropped before reaching anything and the new assertions passed
  over a world that did not contain it. Each pin added for a reason now
  carries an assertion naming that reason.
- **And the first version of that check was worse than nothing.** It asserted
  that every pin lands in one of offered / in-log / completed â€” true by
  construction, unable to fail, and unable to catch the defect it was written
  for, because a dropped pin lands in "completed": that is *how* it was
  dropped. Replaced with the narrow assertion the rule actually asks for.
- **A fixture that identifies its subject by a property it does not own
  breaks when a sibling appears.** The API self-test check was located by
  taking the last check in the "client" area, which was correct only while it
  was the only one there. Adding a second client check made that assertion
  read a different check's status.

## [1.7.0]

**1.6.0's latch closed the one case the test fixture modelled and neither of
the two the client actually produces.** It stopped the addon asking for a
quest title while a request was in flight â€” and the handler for the answer
clears that flag on *every* reply, including `success = false` and including a
success that carries no title. Both are ordinary answers from the client, and
both put the quest straight back into the state that starts a request. The
suite's own request budget, added in that release to catch exactly this,
passed: the test client refused by going silent, which is the one refusal the
real client almost never gives.

**And 1.6.0's comment described an escape hatch that was never built.** It
reads *cleared on a loading screen rather than never, because a refusal can be
transientâ€¦ a latch with no way out turns a momentary refusal into a permanent
one.* Nothing cleared it. That is worse than the missing behaviour: the next
reader checks the note instead of the code. Both tables are cleared on a
loading screen now, and a test asserts it.

### How defects were found

- **The test client refused in the wrong way.** It answered by never
  answering. It now answers `success = false` for one quest and `success =
  true` with no title for another, which are the two refusals the client
  gives, and the mutation covering the second survived until the second was
  modelled.
- **A stub written above the line where `CN` is declared does nothing,
  silently.** The first draft of the refusing-server stub read the addon table
  through a global that is nil at call time and guarded it with `if CN and
  â€¦` â€” so it looked careful and fired no events, and the mutation it was
  written to kill survived while every assertion passed. This file already
  documents that trap beside another stub; the note is now beside this one
  too.
- **An event that arrives in bursts lands on a trailing run.** The check that
  every declared provider event marks its provider dirty asserted immediately,
  which was true until a gathered event started firing during ordinary
  rebuilds. It drains the timer first now, because asserting before that is
  asserting that no event may ever be gathered.

## [1.6.0]

1.5.0 fixed a client request that repeated on every rebuild and wrote down why
no benchmark could have caught it: every benchmark runs against a warm client,
so the branches that talk to the server are never taken. This release built
the measurement that was missing, and it found the same defect on the sibling
system immediately.

**A quest the server will not describe was asked about every two seconds, for
ever.** `Blizzard.GetQuestTitle` records the request in `CN.pendingQuestLoads`
and the handler for the answer clears it â€” and nothing ever read it before
asking again. The candidate provider calls this for every uncached quest pin
on the map and for up to twenty offers in three neighbouring zones, and it
rebuilds every two seconds, so a quest id the client has no data for produced
a request per pin per rebuild for the life of the session. The latch was
already on disk, already named for exactly this, and was written to and never
read.

### Added

- **A request budget in the suite.** Every request-shaped call the addon can
  make is counted across three identical cold rebuilds, and asking for
  anything a second time is a failure. It is a difference rather than an
  absolute, because an absolute is a statement about the fixture and the
  difference is a statement about the addon: a request repeated on the second
  pass repeats for ever, whatever size the fixture is. A new request added
  without a latch now fails on the release that adds it.

### Changed

- The two `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` handlers in `Modules/Instances.lua` are one
  handler. 1.5.0 added the second to clear the lockout answer, leaving two
  halves of one thing in two places that happened to be registered in the
  right order â€” clear the answer, then re-ask â€” with nothing saying so.
  Moving either block would have credited the previous segment's reply to the
  new one.

### How defects were found

- **The test client named every quest it was asked about.** Every offered
  quest in the fixture had a title, so the provider's "ask the server and
  render the id while waiting" branch had never been reached and the request
  it sends had never been counted. There is now a pin the client refuses to
  name and never answers about, which is an ordinary state in game.
- **And the first version of that pin was invisible.** The fixture client
  answers "completed" for every odd quest id below 70000, so an odd pin is
  dropped by the availability filter and reaches nothing â€” it passed every
  assertion by not existing.

## [1.5.0]

Both of this release's defects were written by the two releases before it, and
both were of a shape those releases had already named.

**An item name the client had not cached was asked for again on every look.**
1.4.0 added the request and shipped it unlatched, under a comment arguing that
the client de-duplicates a load already in flight. It does â€” and that says
nothing about the same miss happening again on the next rebuild.
`Modules/Vendors.lua` measures its own loop at 2,503 lookups per rebuild and
that provider rebuilds every five seconds, so a cold item cache meant thousands
of client calls a second for items the server may never answer about. No
benchmark could see it, because every benchmark runs with a warm cache and the
branch that makes the call is never taken. It asks once per item per session
now.

**An unanswered lockout request was reported as a clear week.** 1.2.0 found
that the addon read the lockout list and never asked for it, and sent the
request â€” and left the other half alone: "the server has not answered yet" and
"you are saved to nothing" both arrive as a count of zero, and
`/cn instances` printed *You are not saved to anything* for both. That is worst
in exactly the moment the request was added for, the first seconds after a
login, which is also when somebody types the command. 1.4.0 fixed this same
shape for the inbox and did not sweep for its siblings.

The keystone is deliberately left as it is. It has no event that says "the
answer arrived", so a third state there would replace a briefly wrong *you
have no keystone* with a permanently wrong *still asking* for every character
that genuinely holds none. Where there is no signal, the honest thing is to
say nothing rather than to invent one â€” noted here so the omission is a
decision rather than an oversight.

### How defects were found

- **A justification written into a comment is not a measurement.** The
  unlatched request had a two-clause argument beside it; the first clause was
  true and the second was never traced to the loop it sits in.
- **Every benchmark runs with a warm cache**, so the miss branch of the
  item-name accessor â€” the one that talks to the client â€” has never been
  measured. The guard is an exact count in the suite instead: five hundred
  looks at the same uncached item must send no further requests.
- **A count of zero cannot distinguish an empty answer from no answer**, and
  only an event can. The lockout check now exercises the event path on its
  own, with an empty list, because a test that always answers with rows cannot
  tell whether the handler is wired at all.

## [1.4.0]

The question 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 kept asking â€” *who sends the request?* â€” has now
found four systems. This release found the last two, and one of them is the
most time-critical thing the addon tracks.

**Expiring mail was invisible.** `GetInboxNumItems()` answers zero until the
client has been handed the inbox, and `CheckInbox()` is what asks the server
for it. `/cn waiting` carried a sentence explaining this to the player â€” *"No
mail, or the mailbox has not been opened this session â€” the client only hands
the addon the inbox once you have looked at it"* â€” so the limitation was
understood and apologised for rather than removed. An addon does not need the
player to walk to a mailbox. The candidate provider had no such sentence and
simply emitted nothing, which means mail whose attachments are about to be
destroyed was silently absent for the whole session. The addon asks now, and
"the answer has not come back yet" is its own line rather than being reported
as "no mail".

**And an item name the client had not cached was never asked for.** 1.1.0
taught two providers to listen for `GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED`, because a row
named "Start: item 71715" never became a name. That was half of it: the event
answers a request, and the branch this addon *prefers* does not make one.
`C_Item.GetItemNameByID` reads the cache and returns nil; `GetItemInfo` is the
call that queues an asynchronous load as a side effect, and it is the
fallback. So on any modern client the addon took the path that never asks and
then waited for an answer that could not come â€” a defect created by the fix
for its own symptom, and invisible on a client old enough to take the other
branch.

### How defects were found

- **Four systems now, from one question.** The lockout list (1.2.0), the
  keystone (1.3.0), the inbox and the item cache. Each had a reader, a
  display, and for three of them the event already subscribed.
- **The test client answered an inbox it had never been asked for**, from the
  first release. Twenty-second entry in this project's list of defects hidden
  by a stub that skips a precondition the client enforces.
- **`GetItemInfo` did not exist in the test client at all**, so the fallback
  branch of a function eleven call sites depend on had never once been
  executed â€” a branch that could only be reasoned about, in a file whose
  header exists to make client behaviour testable.

## [1.3.0]

1.2.0 found a system the addon was listening to and never asking. This release
asked that question of everything else, and found the third one â€” and then
found that the fix for a *different* defect had stopped at the language
boundary and left the addon's own toolkit behind.

**The keystone was never asked for.** `C_MythicPlus.GetOwnedKeystoneLevel()`
reads a table the client fills only after `C_MythicPlus.RequestMapInfo()`;
until then it answers zero, and the guard in `Waiting.Keystone` reads a zero as
"this character has no keystone" â€” the right answer for the wrong reason, for
the whole session, unless the player happened to open the Mythic+ UI, which
sends the request for them. So `/cn waiting`'s keystone row and the keystone's
own deadline were silently absent. Third instance of the same shape in two
releases; the lockout fix swept for its siblings in the provider files and this
one lives in a module and never went through `Blizzard` at all.

**`cn.ps1 harvest` could not carry a turn-in location.** The addon began
recording where a quest was handed in â€” the one coordinate the client can
never re-supply â€” in 1.0.0. The companion data addon learned to carry it in its
0.8.0 and to stop dropping such rows in its 0.9.0. The addon's *own* toolkit,
which is the primary path into `Data/Quests.lua` and the one that file's header
points at, had never mentioned the field: a row located only by its hand-in was
counted as having no coordinates and dropped, and a row with both emitted only
the pick-up. Both fixes were followed by the call-site grep this project
requires â€” and the grep was run over the Lua tree, and both writers are
PowerShell.

### How defects were found

- **The provider-event question, asked of requests instead of events.** Two
  releases of "who handles this answer" became "who sends this request", and
  the answer for the third asynchronous system was nobody.
- **The test client answered a keystone it had never been asked for.** The
  stub returned twelve from the line it was written on, so the state every
  player is in at login had never existed in the suite. Twenty-first entry in
  this project's list of defects hidden by a stub that skips a precondition
  the client enforces.
- **A call-site sweep stops at the language boundary unless it is told not
  to.** `cn.ps1`'s harvest emitter is now checked against the field block at
  the top of `Data/Quests.lua` â€” every coordinate field the schema documents
  must be one the emitter can produce, read from the documentation rather than
  from a list kept beside the check.

## [1.2.0]

1.1.0 added "the client's item cache" to the list of systems a provider must
declare, and wrote down why: the weak part of an enumeration is the entry
nobody thought of. Asking that question again found the answer sitting one
file away, with its own event already registered â€” and a second system that
had a handler for an answer to a question the addon never asked.

**The addon was listening for the lockout list and never asking for it.**
`GetNumSavedInstances` reads a table the client does not populate on its own:
`RequestRaidInfo()` asks the server, and `UPDATE_INSTANCE_INFO` â€” which the
instances provider has declared all along, under a comment reading *the client
saying so* â€” is the answer arriving. Without the request the count is zero for
the whole session unless the player happens to open the Raid Info frame, which
sends it for them. So every lockout-shaped answer this addon gives was
silently empty for somebody who logged in and asked what to do next:
`/cn lockouts`, the part-finished-raid recommendation, the vault's dungeon row
and the "Dungeons and raids" section of this addon's own store page. The
request is sent on every loading screen and once per read, and the same
pattern was already handled correctly two hundred lines away in the same file,
for the calendar.

**Quest titles arriving in the background were announced in chat, one line
each.** `Blizzard.GetQuestTitle(id, true)` asks the server for a title the
client has not cached, and the handler for the answer printed it. Every path
that reaches that handler is a background one â€” the candidate provider walking
this map's quest pins, the same provider walking up to twenty offers in three
neighbouring zones, the map-pin sweep, `Chase`. There is no player-facing path
into it at all. So crossing into a zone whose pins the client had not cached
printed a line per quest, up to forty of them, announcing titles for rows
nobody had looked at yet.

**And the row that was waiting for one of those titles kept its number.** The
provider renders "Quest 84732" while it waits, and nothing told it the answer
had come: the title landed in the metadata store and the ranked list went on
showing the number until an unrelated quest event happened along. Exactly the
defect 1.1.0 fixed for the item cache, on its sibling system â€” one that
already had the event, the handler and the store, and no line joining them to
the screen.

### Changed

- `QUEST_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` joins `GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED` as an event that
  gathers before it invalidates. Up to forty answers arrive within a second or
  two of each other as a zone's pins resolve.
- The lockout request is sent at most once per loading screen, not once per
  read: it is a server round trip, and every read of a lockout goes through
  the function that sends it.

### How defects were found

- **The provider-event lint gained a sixth system**, the client's quest title
  cache, and it named the offender on the first run. Rule 161 was written last
  release about the item cache; asking the same question one release later
  cost one entry in a table.
- **The test client answered a lockout list it had never been asked for.** The
  stub has done that since the first release, so the state every player is
  actually in at login had never existed in the suite. Twentieth entry in this
  project's list of defects hidden by a stub simpler than the client, and the
  second in three releases where the missing piece was a *request* rather than
  a read.
- **A requested quest title never arrived in the test client either.**
  `RequestLoadQuestByID` recorded the id and changed nothing, so the answer was
  the same before and after â€” and the whole point of the call is that it is
  not. Every test of that path was exercising the failure branch, including
  the one that fires the success event.
- **Capturing `CN.Print` intercepts nothing.** Every module binds
  `local Print = CN.Print` in its header, so the first draft of the check that
  no chat line is printed passed against the very line it was written for. It
  captures at the chat frame now.

## [1.1.0]

Two defects, both in code 1.0.0 wrote, both of the same shape: **a new kind of
answer arrived and the questions asked about it were the old ones.**

**A quest this addon first meets at its hand-in was recorded as being offered
there.** 1.0.0 gave the harvest record a field that says exactly what a
turn-in coordinate is â€” and left the first-sighting case writing it under the
other name, because the setter that fills a blank field ran first. A player
who installs the addon halfway through a quest had that quest exported with
the turn-in NPC's position as its quest giver, into `/cn export`, into
Navigator Data's staging, and from there into a file whose header reads *every
row in this file was checked by a person*. The coordinate is real, the map is
real, and the claim about it is wrong, which is the one kind of defect a
curation pipeline cannot catch. Such a row now records the hand-in, records no
pick-up, and says so in the export â€” and it is still counted and exported,
because a turn-in is a location and three separate places had been asking
`x and y` since long before there was a second kind.

**Nothing told the addon that an item name had arrived.** The client answers
`nil` for any item it has not seen this session and fills its cache
asynchronously. Two providers read that cache and neither declared its event,
so `/cn next` in the first seconds after a login read "Start: item 71715" and
nothing ever re-asked. The vendor-recipe provider was worse: it joins vendor
stock to recipes *by name*, so it emitted nothing at all â€” a player who logged
in and asked what to do next was told about no vendor-sold recipe until they
happened to open a shop. `Modules/Inventory.lua` has carried the rule since
0.86.0 â€” *a provider must declare the events of every system it reads, not of
the system it is named after* â€” and the item cache had never been counted as a
system.

### Changed

- **Events that arrive in bursts gather before they invalidate.**
  `GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED` fires once per item the client resolves, and it
  resolves a bagful, a bank, a merchant's stock and every quest reward in the
  seconds after a login. Each fire would have walked every provider to set a
  flag that was already set; the first still lands immediately and the burst
  behind it costs one more pass rather than several hundred. Nothing can be
  seen to be slower, because marking a provider stale does not rebuild it â€”
  the two providers that read the item cache have a five-second cooldown, and
  a mark that lands three quarters of a second late cannot delay a rebuild
  that was not going to happen for five.
- **`Quests.GetLocation` asks the client a question only when there is an
  answer to use.** It asked whether a quest was ready to hand in *before*
  asking whether a turn-in location existed â€” a client call per quest, on a
  function the zone router calls once per stop, for the three curated rows in
  existence. The table lookup decides the branch now.
- `/cn harvest` says how many of its located rows are located only by where
  they were handed in. It is a different claim from the rest, and it is the
  one a curator most needs told.

### How defects were found

- **The item cache is a system.** The provider-event lint had four systems in
  it â€” the quest log, your bags, where you are standing, what you have
  collected. Four is a list somebody wrote; the fifth is the one nobody
  thought of, which is the whole reason the check is structural rather than a
  review.
- **A fixture item with no name passes every test that does not ask what the
  row is called.** The bag fixture's quest starter had no entry in the test
  client's item table, so it has rendered as "Start: item 60001" in every run
  this project has ever made â€” including the check added last release that a
  cold item cache still names everything, which could not tell a cold cache
  from a warm one.

## [1.0.0]

0.99.0 went looking for what a new player hits in their first hour and fixed
five steps of `/cn setup` that reported a refusal as a success. This release
audited that fix and found it had broken the same command a different way, for
a different player â€” which is the shape this project has now found in every
release for thirty in a row: **the worst defect in a release lives in the
previous release's own changes.**

**A character who had learned no professions could never finish setup.**
0.99.0 gave the professions step the same "a zero means the client refused"
rule as the eight steps beside it. That rule holds for those eight because
their count is the length of the *client's* list â€” every toy that exists,
every mount, every title â€” so zero can only be a refusal. Professions count
what *this character has learned*, so zero is an ordinary person: every
character, for its first hours, which is exactly when this command is run. A
step that reports "not ready" blocks the whole run from being recorded, so the
login reminder fired for ever, `/cn setup check` answered "Not scanned yet"
for ever, and the report told the player to run `/cn profscan`, which changed
nothing. The addon contradicted itself while it happened: the module marked
itself scanned on the same run the report called it not ready. The refusal is
now reported by the layer that knows rather than inferred from a count.

**"Refresh what is stale" counted every scan that did not crash.** A cold
client refuses without crashing â€” that is the whole point of the guards the
last five releases added â€” so the button answered "Read 12 stale sources" over
twelve sources that were exactly as stale as before, and could never reach
"Nothing is stale", which is the other half of its own sentence. It counts
what actually moved now, and has a third answer for the case where nothing
did. This is the defect 0.99.0 removed from the "Scan everything" button, one
screen away in the same file, in the release whose note on that fix reads *the
fix landed at one call site and not at its sibling in the same file*.

**A fresh alt was shown its main's timestamps.** Two of the twelve sources are
read per character, and the Sources tab dated all twelve from the account-wide
stamp â€” so the tab whose header is "Where every number in this addon comes
from" reported two sources as read today that this character had never read,
and the stale refresh could not run either of them because both looked fresh.

### Added

- **The addon records where a quest was handed in.** `turnInMapID` has been a
  documented field since the three-phase quest model was designed â€” *a quest
  is a pick up, a do, and a turn in* â€” with a reader, a schema and a curated
  data pipeline behind it, and nothing in the addon had ever written one. The
  backlog carries it as *Later* on the grounds that an independent table was
  needed. What was needed was one line in the `QUEST_TURNED_IN` handler, which
  already ran three lines from the capture that was discarding it. Recorded
  only where the hand-in differs from the pick-up, exported for curation, and
  used as the walking target for a quest that is ready to turn in when the
  client will not answer â€” labelled as an observation, because that is what it
  is.
- **`/cn setup again`** forgets what setup recorded and runs it once more. The
  "you are done" flag was written once and read for the life of the install
  with nothing able to clear it, so a setup that completed against a warming-up
  client could never be redone.

### Changed

- `/cn profscan` says which zero it means. "Found 0 professions" was true of a
  character who has learned none and of a client with no profession API, and
  the next move differs.
- The "Scan everything" button counts a profession scan that answered for a
  character with none, rather than reporting the whole press as a refusal.
- Refreshing stale sources reads the source list once instead of three times.

### How defects were found

- **A count is only a refusal signal when it is the client's own list
  length.** Nine steps were given one rule; one of them counts something else.
  The suite now runs `/cn setup` on a character with no professions â€” a state
  the test client had never been in, because its stub has answered with two
  professions since the first release.
- **The item cache is empty until it is not.** Eleven call sites take an item
  name from the client and the rule they rely on â€” *unknown names are skipped
  rather than guessed* â€” had never been exercised. Nothing was found wrong;
  the state is now reachable.
- **The waypoint moves to the hand-in once a quest is ready.** The stub
  answered with one fixed point for the life of a quest, so the only state in
  which a turn-in location is observable had never existed in the suite â€” and
  the addon's failure to record one was invisible with it.

## [0.99.0]

The last release before 1.0, so this one went looking for what a new player
hits in their first hour â€” and found the worst defect of the year there.

**`/cn setup` run on a cold client reported a scan that read nothing as a
success, and then stopped asking for ever.** Five of the twelve steps â€” toys,
mounts, pets, titles and appearances â€” never checked whether the game had
answered. The modules themselves had been taught to refuse a cold read in
0.92.0 and 0.95.0 and to record nothing; setup did not ask, printed the row in
the success colour, and stamped the "you are done" flag. That flag is checked
*before* the list of never-scanned sources, so the guards were defeated by the
one thing they exist to protect. The Welcome screen's own button runs this,
the store page promises the addon "keeps asking until you have", and there was
no command that got the prompt back.

**And the Collections tab's "Scan everything" button did the same thing from
the other direction** â€” it treated "the scan did not throw" as "the scan
worked", so it stamped the very steps the modules had just refused to stamp.
Afterwards the Collections tab and the Scans tab both read "just now" over
empty stores. It counts what was read now, and says so when the answer is
nothing.

### Fixed

- **The one command the addon offers when it has nothing to suggest pointed at
  the wrong list.** "Try `/cn waiting` for what is on a timer" â€” and
  `/cn waiting` lists quests you have walked past and never picked up, which
  on a fresh account answers "Nothing remembered yet". The command about
  timers is `/cn clock`. The rename happened three releases ago and this
  caller was left behind; the check added in 0.96.0 verifies that a named
  command *exists*, and this one did.
- **Two of the twelve sources were missing from the Scans tab** â€” exploration
  and zone achievements. Exploration is the source most certain to go stale,
  because nothing in the addon ever rescans it on its own, and it was the one
  the staleness screen could not see and the "Refresh what is stale" button
  could not run. That button answered "Nothing is stale" without ever asking.
- Three numbers on the store page had drifted from the addon: it offered
  `/cn textsize <100-150>` against a real ceiling of **200** â€” the
  accessibility control, quoting a limit corrected inside the addon in 0.88.0
  â€” said eighteen self-tests against twenty, and described two tabs without a
  list where there is one. The offline suite now checks the page's numbers,
  and every command it names, against the tree.

## [0.98.0]

**The addon's own curated quest data was being refused at load, and nothing
said so.** 0.91.0 removed a field from the set the data registrar accepts; the
shipped row still carried it, so the row was rejected â€” and the rejection was
reported to the error collector, which loads *after* the data file, so it
reached nothing at all. `/cn provenance` reported zero hand-checked rows and
read exactly like a table nobody had filled in yet. Both halves are fixed: the
row, and the silence. A complaint made before the collector exists is now held
and delivered when it arrives.

**For half an hour after every login, the Darkmoon Faire did not exist.** The
calendar is asynchronous â€” it answers "no events" until the server sends the
month â€” and the login warm-up cached that answer for thirty minutes. No row in
`/cn next`, no map pin, no heads-up line, no "Active events" in `/cn now`.
Only `/cn events` repaired it, and nothing told you to run it. An empty
calendar is not cached at all now; a real one still is.

### Fixed

- **Putting a rare off did not stop the alert.** Right-clicking the heads-up
  line, or `/cn later`, removed the rare from every list â€” and then the addon
  made the one unsolicited noise it is capable of, a sound and a chat line,
  about that exact rare the next time it drifted into range. This was the only
  place in the addon that checked "ignored" without also checking "deferred".
- **Pinning a reputation as a goal switched off its Warband advice.** Goals
  were marked account-wide whatever they were, and that flag means "the
  progress carries across your Warband" â€” so the "Bob is better suited,
  highest standing" verdict was withdrawn for the one faction you had just
  said you cared about, while `/cn goals` went on naming Bob. Two screens
  contradicting each other about one row.

### Changed

- Two stored values with no reader anywhere â€” a mount's spell id and a pet's
  type, about 2,700 numbers between them â€” are gone from the two largest
  stores, written at every logout and parsed at every login for nothing.
  Migration 38 removes them from existing databases.
- `Group.Situation` is still asked once per candidate. A cache for it was
  written, measured at 11â€“14% of a re-rank that sits well inside its budget,
  and reverted: it is only correct while every change to death, group and
  doorway announces itself, and that is not a dependency worth a tenth of a
  millisecond. The measurement is recorded in the file so the next audit does
  not spend an afternoon rediscovering it.

## [0.97.0]

**Running `/cn setup` in the first seconds after logging in erased your
exploration progress and then stopped the addon ever asking you to scan
again.** The criteria API refuses for a moment after login â€” which is when
setup is usually run â€” and the exploration scan wrote that refusal into the
store as a real measurement: every zone's criteria count zeroed, every
character's progress zeroed. Both the "closest to finishing" list and the
exploration recommendations filter on a criteria count above zero, so they
went empty, and nothing runs that scan on its own. The guard for this has been
thirty lines away in the same file since 0.61.0, and five other modules cite
it as the precedent for the guard they carry. It landed at one call site and
not the other one beside it.

**Every renown level-up rebuilt your entire faction list twice.** The
reputation sweep's throttle was stamped by one event handler rather than by
the sweep, so the login scan, both renown handlers, `/cn repscan` and the
recommendation pass all ran it and left the throttle unarmed â€” and the next
faction tick immediately ran it again. Each sweep walks every faction three
times and holds your collapsed reputation headers open while it does.

### Fixed

- **A faction list the game had not sent yet was recorded as a completed
  scan** â€” Reputations is the first of the thirteen setup steps, so it is the
  most exposed to a cold client, and stamping it stops the reminder for the
  life of the install. Sixth scanner to need that guard.
- **`/cn drops` matched your lockout by the instance's translated name.** Both
  sides carry the Adventure Guide's own id and the addon compared two
  localized strings from two different game APIs instead. When they differ by
  anything â€” punctuation, a subtitle, a rename applied to one API and not the
  other â€” the "locked, resets in 2d 3h" clause silently vanished, which is the
  one line that decides whether the trip is worth making. Goals used the same
  path and lost the "you are saved to it and it is cleared" step the same way.
- **A missing boss list blamed the wrong thing.** The guard refused on a field
  the function never uses and told the player "the client did not name this
  instance" â€” directly under a row displaying that name.

### Changed

- The published list of game APIs this addon touches was generated by scanning
  the toolkit's whole file list, which includes the test harness â€” so an API
  only the offline stubs mention was reported as one the addon requires.
  `/cn capture` and the fixture audit both read that list.

## [0.96.0]

**Reloading on the same day moved today's quest count into "yesterday", about
half the time.** The addon works out which day it is from when the next quest
reset falls, and the game does not answer that question immediately after you
log in â€” so the addon estimates, and the estimate lands on a different day
from the true reset for roughly half of all login times. It then took its own
estimate as proof that the day had turned and shovelled the count across.
`/cn progress` read "Today: 0, Previous day: 12" after a reload, on the same
game day. It waits for the client now, which answers moments later.

**`/cn find` with no matches told you to type a command that does not exist.**
The recovery line shown at the exact moment you have failed to find something
named `/cn scan`; the command is `/cn setup`. The offline suite now checks
every command this addon names in its own output against the commands it
actually registers.

### Fixed

- **A Warband bank the game would not describe was reported as freshly
  read.** For a player who has bought no Warband bank tab â€” the common case â€”
  `/cn bags` said "0 kinds of item, seen just now", permanently, about a bank
  the addon has never seen. Same shape as 0.95.0's cold toy box and 0.94.0's
  cold recipe list: a refusal recorded as a successful read, on the one field
  that says whether anything was read. A refusal now keeps whatever the last
  real reading recorded, and records nothing if there has never been one.
- **The value column did not grow with the text size.** Row height and line
  spacing were both taught to follow `/cn textsize` in 0.90.0; the width of
  the right-hand column was not, and the width is applied regardless. At 150%
  the longest value wrapped onto a second line and overflowed its row onto the
  one below, on the two tabs that use that column most â€” in the feature built
  for the players least likely to go hunting for a command.
- Two em dashes sat against the word before them, in a goal's explanation and
  in a bag objective's progress line.

### Changed

- The map-pin click comment described the opposite of what the code does. The
  behaviour was right; the comment would have sent the next reader to "fix"
  working code.
- A stray colour terminator in the middle of a `/cn providers` sentence, and a
  count in a comment that had been out of date for four releases â€” the file
  now points at the command that prints the live figure instead.

## [0.95.0]

**At every login with a cold Pet Journal or Toy Box, the addon wiped filters
you had chosen â€” and told you it could not put them back.** Both journals
answer zero while they are still loading, which is exactly when the addon
scans them, and both read that zero as "your source and type checkboxes are
hiding everything" and widened them. The client offers no getter for those
checkboxes, so the widening is permanent. The guard written for this in 0.92.0
sits *inside* the scan, which runs after the widening has already happened â€” a
guard that runs after the writes is not a guard. Both now check a count the
filters cannot touch first, so "you filtered everything out" and "the journal
has not answered yet" are told apart before anything is changed.

**A raid lockout you are no longer saved to was being offered as spent effort
about to expire.** The client reports a `locked` flag per instance; the addon
has read it into its own records since that code was written and never once
looked at it, inferring the same fact from the reset countdown instead. But an
expired lockout stays in the list with time still showing on it. So the
strongest urgency signal this addon emits â€” "six bosses already down, resets
soon" â€” was being raised for an instance you would have to clear from zero.

### Fixed

- **A cold toy box, mount journal or title list was recorded as a completed
  scan.** Stamping that flag removes the step from the setup reminder for the
  life of the install, so a new player was never told to run the scan, and the
  Scans tab read "just now" over a read that returned nothing. Pets got this
  guard in 0.92.0, currencies in 0.88.0, achievements in 0.76.0, exploration
  in 0.61.0 and Loremaster in 0.71.0; these three were the ones the sweep
  never reached, and all three scan at login.
- **A wardrobe that had not loaded was cached as an empty one for the whole
  session.** The only thing that clears that cache is collecting a transmog,
  so a player who collected nothing had `/cn sets` reporting zero and the sets
  provider silent until they logged out â€” losing the "3 of 5 pieces"
  denominator this addon is otherwise short of.
- **A bag of caged pets cost a full journal sweep per pet.** That sweep is the
  most expensive single event in the addon by a factor of forty, and each one
  also saves, clears and restores your own journal search and checkboxes. The
  first pet still answers immediately; the rest of a burst collapse into one.
  The routing file has debounced its own handler for this event for releases,
  naming the pet module as the reason.
- **`CN.UnregisterQuestDataProvider` was defined inside another function.** It
  existed only as a side effect of a successful registration, so a third-party
  addon calling the published API before registering anything got an error out
  of it.
- Chat separators were missing their leading space in four places, so counts
  and separators collided â€” and two labels spelled a pending state as three
  middle dots rather than an ellipsis.

### Changed

- The reset-proximity branch of the lockout urgency term has been removed. It
  has been unreachable since 0.88.0 moved that deadline onto the scorer's own
  curve, and it read as though the term still weighted it â€” an invitation to
  charge the same reset a third time.
- Two routing helpers with no callers are gone, along with a comment claiming
  in the present tense that one of them was doing the conversion the file
  relies on. There is one implementation of that conversion now.

## [0.94.0]

**Opening a profession window before the game had sent the recipe list was
recorded as having read it.** The client reports the window as ready before the
recipes arrive, and the addon wrote "0 of 0 recipes, read" to disk anyway â€”
which is the one flag that stops it asking. `/cn setup` dropped "open each
profession window once", the Collections tab dropped the same hint, and the
state survived every login, because a rescan deliberately preserves it. The
addon had made a claim about data it never read and removed the sentence that
would have told you how to fix it.

**A currency capped on what you have *earned* was telling you to spend your way
out of it.** Some caps are measured against lifetime or seasonal earnings
rather than the balance you hold. Spending moves the balance; the cap does not
move. So the addon issued a high-urgency task that provably could not be
satisfied, brought it back after every weekly reset, and left `/cn ignore` as
the only escape. It now says what is true: at cap, and this one is on total
earned.

**With two data addons installed, the addon named the wrong one as
authoritative.** A quest claimed by two suppliers recorded the first as the
winner and then let the second overwrite it. `/cn selftest` printed that
straight to you, so the wrong addon got disabled. First registration wins now â€”
which is what the code, the self-test and `/cn provenance` all already claimed,
and it is the only answer that stops a supplier silently replacing this addon's
own hand-checked rows. A supplier replacing its *own* rows has had a way to do
that since 0.92.0.

### Fixed

- **Setup could complete permanently on a currency read the game refused.**
  `Currencies.Scan` documents `0` as its refusal â€” "what the client returns
  while currency data is still streaming at login, which is exactly when this
  runs" â€” and setup reported it in the success colour, counted it, and stamped
  the completion flag. The login reminder then never fired again while
  `/cn currencies` said "No currency data yet." Third step to need this guard;
  0.73.0 and 0.86.0 fixed the other two without asking which else returned a
  refusal shaped like a success. Professions is covered now too.
- **A currency list the game refused mid-read left your collapsed headers
  forced open.** The sweep expands every collapsed group, reads, and puts them
  back; the early return between those two halves skipped the restore. Rare,
  and permanent when it happened, against that function's own promise that
  what it changes to read, it changes back.
- **Chat output padded with spaces in five more places.** Three spaces are not
  a column: they are three spaces, and they are a different width after "7"
  than after "142". The 0.77.0 sweep reached three files and the 0.92.0 sweep
  reached one more; this one reached `Progress`, `Toys`, `Mounts` and
  `Loremaster`.
- An empty search result left the previous row's highlight in place â€” no
  visible symptom, and not what the note beside it claimed.

### Changed

- **The quest-log sweep stamps its own throttle.** It was stamped by the event
  handler alone, so the login hook and `/cn discoveractive` left it unarmed â€”
  and `QUEST_LOG_UPDATE` fires within the same second in both cases. The most
  expensive scan in the addon, which walks every related map's points of
  interest with a write and a title request per pin, ran twice at every login.
  `Modules/Currencies.lua` records fixing this exact shape in 0.65.0; the fix
  landed in one file and nowhere else.
- **`/cn discoveractive` counted the walk it had already made.** It swept the
  neighbourhood and then swept it again to produce a number the first sweep
  already held.
- **A mouseover resolves an item once.** The mount and pet lookups were each
  performed twice per tooltip â€” on what the benchmark file calls the hottest
  path in the addon, where a bag sweep or an auction page fires dozens a
  second.
- **Typing in the filter box no longer searches every other tab on every
  keystroke.** The cross-tab count walked the entries of all eleven tabs
  twice per character typed, and kept building throwaway strings after it
  already had its answer. Debounced, and it stops at the first match â€” the
  first keystroke still answers immediately.
- The Great Vault is read once per refresh rather than twice.

## [0.93.0]

**An achievement could not get onto the shortlist by getting closer to done.**
The five-second criteria sweep â€” the thing that keeps "3 of 5 rares" honest
while you are out doing it â€” only ever looked at achievements that were
*already* on the shortlist. An achievement one step from finishing sat unread
until something else forced a full rescan, which meant the sweep did its best
work precisely where it was least needed and none at all where it mattered.

The rest of this release is a sweep of a rule this project has stated in six
files and broken in two: **a localized string is for display, never to persist**.
Faction and transmog-slot names were being written to disk on every scan and
read back on every list, so a player who changed client language kept reading
the old one until something happened to rescan â€” up to ten minutes, for
appearances.

### Fixed

- **Appearance slots were named from disk, in whatever language you used
  last.** `Modules/Appearances.lua` made this exact argument in 0.58.0 and was
  never swept itself: nine other modules have a live-name accessor with the
  same comment, three of them naming this file as the precedent. It had none,
  and `/cn next`, `/cn appearances` and the filter labels all read the stored
  string. The client re-supplies the name instantly, so it is asked every
  time now, and migration 37 takes the field off disk.
- **Faction names were stored twice.** Reputations already keep a separate
  name index; each record was carrying its own copy as well, per scope. The
  copy is gone and the index is the single source, on the account side and
  the character side both.
- **A collapsed reputation header hid factions from the addon's own test
  suite.** Not a player-visible bug, but the reason one was possible: the
  offline client model listed every faction regardless of whether its header
  was collapsed, so the code that expands the list before scanning could have
  been deleted outright and nothing would have complained. The model now
  hides what the game hides, and a faction behind a collapsed header is what
  proves the expansion works.
- **`/cn nav` described its argument as something else.** The help line named
  a parameter the command does not take.

### Changed

- **The criteria sweep now watches a band, not a list.** Anything within twice
  the "nearly done" threshold is polled, so an achievement can enter the
  shortlist by approaching completion rather than only by being on it already.
- **Teleport readiness is computed once and reused.** The list of teleports
  and their cooldowns was rebuilt from scratch for every candidate on another
  continent â€” dozens of client calls per refresh. It is cached against an
  explicit revision now, bumped when bags change, when a teleport is cast and
  at login, and expires on its own when the shortest cooldown it saw runs out.
  A cache with no expiry would have held a finished cooldown for ever, because
  nothing fires when one ends.
- **Zone goals are recached when the candidate list moves.** The goal-zone
  cache keyed only on its own generation, so a rebuild of the candidates left
  it answering from before.
- **A single appearance-slot name no longer walks every slot.** The filter
  label enumerated the whole category list and compared IDs to find one name.

### Performance

- Route optimisation is now measured at 200 stops as well as 90 â€” one zone's
  worth of a full completionist sweep â€” and confirmed to scale exactly
  quadratically with no hidden term. It carries a ceiling now, so a change
  that moves that work back onto the refresh path is caught by a number.
- The cross-continent travel estimate had never been measured at all: every
  point in the offline fixture sat on one continent, so the branch that walks
  your teleports and costs the onward journey from each had no number beside
  it. It has one, and a budget.

## [0.92.0]

**A deferral set to "forever" was writing a value the game cannot read back.**
`/cn defer forever` stored a deadline of infinity; the client serialises that
as the bare word `inf`, which on the next login parses as an undefined global
and comes back as nothing. The addon wrote a deadline and read back nil,
silently, every session. It happened to behave correctly â€” a missing deadline
means "never expires" â€” which is not the same as being correct, and is one
line away from a bug nobody could reproduce. Forever is now stored as what it
is: the absence of a deadline.

This release also finishes the work of making a companion data addon a real
citizen rather than an invisible one.

### Fixed

- **Caging a pet scanned the whole journal twice.** One handler cleared the
  scan timestamp and then scanned, which makes the throttle in the handler
  beside it read as "never scanned" â€” so the sweep that widens and restores
  your own journal filters ran, and then ran again. `Modules/Currencies.lua`
  records fixing this exact shape in 0.65.0, in as many words.
- **A cold pet journal was recorded as an empty collection.** The journal
  answers with nothing for a moment after login, which is when the addon
  scans it. That threw away the pet name index â€” 1,800 client calls to
  rebuild, on the tooltip path â€” marked the setup step done so the reminder
  stopped asking, and made `/cn petscan` print "0 species" while `/cn pets`
  reported the full collection a second later. Four other scans have carried
  this guard for releases; pets was the fifth without one.
- **`/cn who` named the character who had already done the thing.** For a
  recipe or a title, the character the addon picks is the one who *has* it â€”
  there is nothing to switch to. Three other callers have honoured that since
  0.79.0, 0.84.0 and 0.88.0, and the last of those calls itself "the third
  caller" in a comment. This was the fourth, and it is the command whose help
  line is "Which character should do something".
- **"In your current zone" was not a claim about the zone.** The check asked
  whether the game would tell the addon where you were standing at all â€” so a
  rare on a different map still said it was here, and a rare genuinely here
  lost the line indoors or mid-loading-screen, which is exactly when somebody
  reads it.
- **`/cn sells` now says what something costs.** The price has been stored on
  disk since vendors were added, under a comment explaining that the client
  only reports it while the merchant window is open and it genuinely cannot be
  recovered later. Nothing then printed it. It also distinguishes a gold price
  from a currency or token cost, which is the difference that decides whether
  the walk is worth it.
- **A duplicate command name was recorded where nobody looks.** The addon has
  recorded every slash command claimed twice since it was written, under a
  comment reading "`/cn selftest` names them". Nothing named them. Both that
  list and the curated-data collision list are reported now, with the
  conflicting names spelled out rather than counted.
- **Three translations had been stripped of their own alphabet.** Three
  strings added in 0.78.0 were transliterated in Russian and had their accents
  removed in French and Portuguese, while each of those files spells the same
  words correctly elsewhere. A Russian player finishing a route read Latin
  script between two Cyrillic lines. The build now refuses an all-ASCII value
  in a file that is otherwise accented.
- **The "and N more not shown" row took the mouse.** List rows are reused, so
  when that line landed on an index that had held a clickable row, it still lit
  up under the cursor and still swallowed the click â€” while doing nothing.
- **A trailing space in the search box broke the cross-tab count.** "Also on:
  Collections (0)" beside a Collections tab showing twelve matches. Two places
  normalised the search text differently.
- **Seven printed lines padded their columns with spaces.** WoW has no
  monospace font in its UI, so the second label never lines up. The 0.77.0
  sweep reached three files; the rest are done, and the build checks for it
  now â€” while allowing the three shapes that are not padding, including the
  addon generating Lua source for its own data files.
- **Two more stores kept a timestamp nothing reads**, and migration 36 removes
  them.

### Changed â€” data suppliers

- **`/cn providers` answers the question its help line asks.** Its job is
  "show which external data addons were detected", and it listed only the two
  live-query registries. An addon that hands over curated rows registers once
  and stops, so the one command named for this could not see it. It now names
  each supplier and how many rows it contributed.
- **`/cn selftest` reports curated data**, including which supplier provided
  what, and treats "no supplier installed" as a normal state rather than a
  problem.
- **A bad supplier can no longer bury every other error.** Refused rows were
  recorded one per row against a twenty-entry ring, so twenty-one bad rows
  evicted everything else that session â€” including the supplier's own summary.
  One entry per registration now, with the count and the first reason.
- **A supplier can test what it is talking to.** `CN.Static.apiVersion` says
  what the registrar promises, which the addon's version string cannot. Before
  this, a companion built for the current contract would load against an old
  build, get nothing back, and have all of its rows counted as hand-checked by
  this addon.
- **A supplier can withdraw its rows**, so registering twice is no longer a
  collision with itself. Quest data providers can be withdrawn too, and
  `/cn providers` survives one going away mid-session.

## [0.91.0]

**This release makes the addon's data contract real, because something is
about to use it.** Completion Navigator has published a way for other addons
to contribute curated quest data since 0.43.0. Audited properly for the first
time, that surface turned out to accept anything, tell the caller nothing,
throw on a nil argument where the registrar beside it returned zero, stamp no
record of who supplied a row â€” and then report every row in the table under
the heading "each one checked by hand". Four of its five registration
functions wrote into tables nothing anywhere read.

None of that mattered while the only thing reading the contract was this
addon. All of it matters now.

### Fixed

- **`/cn capture` recorded five APIs as missing from your client that this
  addon only probes for.** `/cn selftest` has had an exemption list for those
  five since the day their absence made it report a failure on every Retail
  client. The list landed in the self-test and nowhere else; this is the
  sibling call site over the same list, and the first genuine contributed
  recording would have failed the build. Ninth time a fix has landed at one
  call site in this project.
- **`/cn breakdown` claimed a location count it never computed.** It reported
  every harvested quest as "harvested with location data", where coordinates
  are only recorded when the client resolved a waypoint â€” which for a
  turned-in or off-map quest it does not. The real figure was already being
  calculated one function away. This is the report whose own header says it
  exists so the addon never invents an authoritative-looking number.
- **A breadcrumb quest you have walked past is now reported as gone.** The
  data schema has documented `breadcrumb` â€” "skippable and permanently
  missable" â€” since 0.43.0, and the addon has carried a block reason for it
  just as long. Neither had a producer, so a curator following the addon's own
  schema wrote something that reached nothing. A breadcrumb whose target you
  have started or finished is removed by the game; telling a completionist to
  go and find it sends them somewhere for something that is not there.
- **A curated row written to the addon's own documented schema could lose to
  another addon's answer.** The data file's header documents `minLevel` and
  `faction`; the code read `requiresLevel` and `requiresFaction`, which is
  what `/cn export` emits. So hand-curated rows and harvested rows in the same
  file gated through different code paths, and one of the two was not treated
  as authoritative â€” contradicting the comment three lines above it. Both
  spellings work now, and both are documented.
- **`/cn mode leveling` advertised a travel weighting it does not apply.**
  Its note has always read "weighted toward fast travel" while the profile
  behind it had no travel weight at all. The sentence is what changed, not the
  number: giving the profile the weighting it claimed takes a placeless
  objective below zero, which the suite catches â€” so the promise had a
  consequence nobody has measured. `/cn mode fastest` is the one that weights
  travel, and it is tuned.
- **`/cn alts`, `/cn provenance` and six stored fields.** The curated count
  now reports only rows this addon checked itself; the currency store, the
  progress record and the harvest store between them stop persisting six
  fields nothing has ever read, and migration 35 removes them from databases
  that have them.

### Changed

- **Contributing curated quest data is now a real contract.** Rows are
  validated on arrival â€” a numeric-string key, a field the addon does not
  read, a missing record are each refused with a reason rather than stored
  and silently ignored. Registration reports how many rows landed and how
  many did not. Every row carries its supplier, so `/cn provenance` reports
  another addon's rows separately from hand-checked ones rather than counting
  them as the same thing. Two suppliers claiming one quest is recorded rather
  than resolved in favour of whoever loaded last. There is a schema version,
  and a supplier built for a different one is told. Rows registered after
  login now invalidate the caches they need to.
- **The curated quest sweep is a shortlist rather than a walk of the whole
  database.** It walked every curated row and asked the eligibility engine
  about each â€” which, for a row without gating fields, means a call into every
  other quest addon you have installed. With one shipped row that was free.
  With a few thousand it is thousands of cross-addon lookups every two seconds
  while questing. It is also capped now, like the five providers beside it.
- **Four registration functions that wrote into nothing are gone.** Recipes,
  vendors, rares and treasures each had a published registrar, a table, and no
  reader anywhere in the addon. A supplier using them would have got a
  successful call and no change to anything a player sees. A published
  surface either works or is not published.
- **The offline suite's quest log now contains zone headers, and its daily
  reset counts down.** The client's log includes header rows and the addon
  filters them out â€” a filter that had never once been exercised. The reset
  API returns a countdown; the test double returned a fixed number whatever
  the clock said, so the one invariant the reset logic rests on was
  unobservable. Twenty-first and twenty-second entries in this project's list
  of defects hidden by a test double simpler than the client.

## [0.90.0]

**This release is mostly about the window, and it starts with a stub that had
been lying since the window was written.** The offline test suite's fake
`GetTextWidth` returned 60 for every caption at every text size, where the
game returns the rendered width. The tab strip sizes its eleven buttons from
exactly that call â€” so "does a caption still fit its button at 150% text?" was
a question no test could ask, and the answer was no. Nothing re-measured the
strip after a text-size change at all. Fixing the stub found that, a row pitch
that never grew with the text it held, and a sort caption drawn on top of the
first row of four tabs.

That makes twenty defects this project has traced to a test double being
simpler or more forgiving than the real client.

### Fixed

- **`/cn scale` did not reach the navigation arrow, the follow frame, or the
  welcome screen.** All three are built the first time they are needed rather
  than at login, and the only thing that applies the saved scale runs at
  login. So somebody who set 1.5 got the window and the heads-up line at 1.5
  and the arrow â€” the frame the setting most obviously exists for, drawn over
  the world at a distance â€” at 1.0, every session. The window and the
  heads-up line were each given this fix in an earlier release; it landed on
  two of five frames.
- **Text sizes above about 130% broke the window's layout.** Tab captions grew
  inside buttons sized for 100% and overflowed into their neighbours; list
  rows kept a fixed 20-pixel pitch under a font the same setting takes to
  24pt, so rows overlapped and the scrollbar's range fell short of the list.
  Both are re-measured now. This is the accessibility control, and above
  150% it had been making the window worse rather than better.
- **The sort caption was drawn across the first row.** It is anchored inside
  the list, under a comment explaining that the first row starts below the
  scroll frame's inset. There was no inset. On Collections, Remaining,
  Warband and Journey, "sort: as ranked" sat on top of the first row's
  number.
- **Map route numbers did not follow you.** The pin cache was keyed on what
  the addon knows and not on where you are standing, and nothing invalidated
  it when you moved â€” so you could open the map at one end of a zone, run to
  the other end, open it again, and get the stops still ordered from where you
  had been. Route order is the whole point of the feature. It is keyed on your
  position now, coarsened to the same grid the router already uses so that
  panning the map still costs nothing.
- **The tooltip said "Faction-locked" about mounts of your own faction.** In
  the warning colour, under "not collected", which reads as "you cannot have
  this" â€” about roughly half the faction mounts in the game. It now names the
  faction that actually holds it, in the client's own language, and says
  nothing at all about a mount you can collect. The two halves of that tooltip
  also disagreed depending on whether you had run `/cn mountscan`; they no
  longer do.
- **`/cn navdiag` reported an unmeasured map scale as a fact.** The function
  returns a third value meaning "this is a shrug, not a measurement" and its
  own header says callers wanting yards must check it. Two other files do. The
  diagnostic command â€” the one whose output goes into bug reports â€” did not,
  so during a loading screen or in an instance it printed "map scale 1 x 1
  yards across".
- **`/cn alts` reported a character with no recorded play time as played
  today.** The suggestion line rebuilt a record from an age in days, where
  "unknown" collapses to zero, which collapses to now. The roster list twenty
  lines below reads the real record and says "never seen".
- **`/cn harvestnow` said "Harvested 0 quests" right after harvesting every
  quest in the log.** The number it printed was quests that learned something
  new, and the login sweep had already learned it. It now says how many it
  harvested and, separately, how many of those told it something.
- **Two window lists padded their numbers with spaces.** WoW has no monospace
  font in its UI, so padding rows 1â€“9 with a leading space moved the periods
  further out of line rather than into it. The chat side has been swept for
  this three times.
- **A sighting counter nothing has ever read is gone.** One integer per
  (quest, prerequisite) pair on a 2,000-row store, written on every quest
  accepted inside a five-minute window and serialised at every logout.
  Migration 34 removes it and the migration that seeded it stops seeding it.

## [0.89.0]

**Five providers were charging one deadline twice.** Last release found the
pattern in the Great Vault and the raid lockout list and fixed both; this
release went looking for the rest of it and found expiring mail, your
keystone, the week's profession knowledge, a capped currency and a crafting
order â€” each feeding one fact into a flat bonus *and* into the urgency curve,
through two shapes tuned independently, only one of which `/cn urgency` plots.
Mail carried the largest: nine points of flat bonus on top of the ramp, which
is why "3 mail expiring" could outrank a world quest with nine minutes left.

The harness now sweeps every provider in the addon for that shape on every
build, with the two legitimate exceptions declared on the rows themselves. It
is the sixth time this project has fixed one instance of a rule and left its
siblings, and the first time the check that finds them all has been written.

### Fixed

- **Mail, the keystone, weekly knowledge, capped currencies and crafting
  orders each charged their deadline once**, not twice.
- **A cold `/cn setup` wrote a junk row for every incomplete achievement in
  the game.** The criteria API answers "0 of 0" for a window after login â€”
  which the file's own note says is exactly when a first scan is run â€” and a
  zero was taken as a real answer. Those rows were unrepairable afterwards
  and the prune deliberately kept them, so the store filled with thousands of
  entries rewritten to disk on every logout, and `/cn achievements` reported
  "Tracked in progress: 3000" for a player with a dozen. The refusal guard was
  already there; it just ran after the writes.
- **An achievement with every criterion done was offered as the one closest
  to finishing.** The client is slow to flip the completed flag, so a 12-of-12
  row sorted to the very top of a list headed "closest to completion". The
  sibling rule in the Loremaster and Exploration lists has carried the guard
  since 0.71.0 â€” and its note says, in as many words, that a third copy exists
  elsewhere. This was it.
- **Flight paths were being timed as ground-mount speed.** The speed sampler
  excludes the taxi from its flying bucket, under a comment saying that
  movement belongs to the flight-path measurement instead â€” and then caught it
  in the mounted bucket, whose plausibility band happens to admit every flight
  speed in the game. Two other files state as fact that this already worked.
  It matters because on-foot speed falls back to the mounted median, and that
  feeds every journey estimate, `/cn plan`'s budget, and the "can I still get
  there in time" test.
- **A quest an NPC offered you fifteen minutes ago was reported as being in
  whatever zone you are standing in now.** The row said "available to pick up
  in this zone" while its travel cost was measured against the zone you were
  actually in when you heard about it, `/cn available` counted it, and walking
  into an empty zone could announce three quests that are not there.
- **Opening a profession window made the next item you hovered rebuild a
  2,500-entry index.** The capture bumped the index's revision once per
  recipe whether or not anything had changed, on an event that fires in
  bursts. It bumps when a name actually changes now.
- **`/cn chase` gave a confident time estimate when exactly half the steps
  had never been timed** â€” the rule printed beside it says an estimate is
  offered only when *more* are timed than are not.
- **`/cn situation` counted you among the people you were with** â€” "in an
  instance with 5 people" to somebody standing with four others.
- **`/cn clock`'s help named two commands' contents and not its own.** It
  advertised the vault and lockouts, which are `/cn vault` and
  `/cn instances`, and left out mail and heirlooms, which are the two largest
  things it prints.
- **The exploration store kept a timestamp nothing reads.** Three earlier
  migrations removed this field from six other stores; this one was in none of
  the sweeps. Migration 33 drops it and the writer stops adding it back.
- **Thirty-five lines of unreachable chase code were deleted.** They built a
  path for an appearance goal, and no appearance goal can be created â€” nor
  should the gap be closed as written, since the builder asks the client for a
  third kind of id from the two the addon actually uses. The harness now
  refuses any chase builder for a goal type nothing can pin.

### Changed

- **Finding a candidate by type and id is an index rather than a walk.** It
  runs on every mount, pet and toy tooltip and once per step of every chase
  chain; a mouse crossing a full bag now builds the index once instead of
  re-walking the list per row.

## [0.88.0]

**Six of this release's ten fixes are the same shape: a number the addon
computes correctly and then uses twice, or a table it defines and never
reads.** None of them throws an error, which is why they lasted. All of them
change what the addon tells you to do next.

The largest is a currency store that emptied itself. `Currencies.Scan` bumps
a serial and stamps every currency it finds with it; everything downstream â€”
what is capped, what has weekly earning left, how many currencies you have at
all â€” asks whether a row carries the current serial. The scan bumped the
serial *before* it knew the game had answered. The game answers with nothing
on four ordinary paths, one of which is the first seconds after login, which
is exactly when the addon runs this. So one login could retire every currency
you own while the rows sat intact on disk. Three other scans in this addon
have carried the guard for that since 0.61.0, 0.71.0 and 0.76.0.

### Fixed

- **A currency sweep the game refused no longer retires every currency you
  own.** It also stops stamping its own throttle on a refusal, so the next
  coin you pick up retries rather than waiting out a minute on an answer that
  was never given.
- **The Great Vault and your raid lockouts charged the weekly reset twice.**
  Both fed the reset into `limitedTimeBonus` *and* into `expiresIn`, through
  two curves tuned separately â€” and `/cn urgency`, which the addon offers as
  its own explanation of the ordering, plots only one of them. On a Sunday
  evening the vault outranked things it should not have, and the chart said it
  should not have.
- **The one character who can still learn a recipe was ranked *down* for
  it.** `Warband.Suitability` asks which character is best placed for
  something and drops the answer's fourth value, which says whether switching
  would actually help. For a recipe or a title, the character named is the one
  who *already has it* â€” there is nothing to switch for â€” so the penalty
  landed on the only character it could still be done on, with the holder's
  name printed as the reason. Third caller of a fix made in 0.79.0 and again
  in 0.84.0.
- **A holiday that had finished outranked every event still running.** The
  event list is held for thirty minutes and re-dated on each read; a finished
  event correctly lost its countdown and then stayed in the list, and a
  missing countdown is how the addon marks "an event the game will not date",
  which is worth three points. A live event three hours out earns about one
  and a third.
- **`/cn defer` â€” put something off for longer than an hour.** The addon has
  had a table of durations since it had a filter tab, with `Until reset`
  described in its own header as the one that matches how the game actually
  works. Nothing read the table: every deferral in the tree was a hardcoded
  hour. Two of its rows could not have worked anyway. Now: `hour`, `day`,
  `tomorrow`, `week`, `reset`, `forever`.
- **Selling a stack of greys no longer re-reads the vendor sixty times.**
  `MERCHANT_UPDATE` fires on every stock change; the whole merchant window was
  re-scanned and re-stored each time. It is throttled to once every two
  seconds, with the last change still read.
- **`/cn events` says when an event ends.** It printed an internal token that
  reads `ONGOING` for every row in a list already filtered to ongoing events,
  and dropped the one fact the provider two hundred lines above already
  computes and ranks on.
- **`/cn help` said the largest text size was 150%.** It is 200%. Three
  constants described one ceiling and the one shown to the players who most
  need larger text was the wrong one.
- **Four lines put a space on one side of an em dash and not the other.**
  Found by a new check rather than by eye; chat has no monospace font to hide
  it behind.
- **A dead scoring curve was deleted.** It was kept "for the one caller that
  has no deadline"; that caller reads a literal and always has.

### Added

- **`/cn defer [hour|day|tomorrow|week|reset|forever]`**, aliases `later` and
  `snooze`. Defers whatever is currently being recommended. `/cn unhide <id>`
  brings it back sooner.

## [0.87.0]

**Last release fixed how a caged pet in your bags is identified, and paid for
it with a full search of the pet journal on every item you hover.** That
lookup runs from the tooltip and from the bag sweep â€” the two busiest paths in
the addon â€” and the search it was routed through walks every species you have
ever seen, lowercasing each name. This addon has removed exactly that shape
from two other hot paths and left a note each time. It is an index now, built
once and only when the pet store actually changes.

Everything in this release is something 0.86.0 broke or left half-done.

### Fixed

- **Hovering an item no longer searches the whole pet journal.**
- **The first version of that index was worse than the search.** It rebuilt
  whenever *any* collection counter moved â€” a quest turn-in, a reputation
  tick, walking through a portal â€” none of which touch pets, and each rebuild
  asked the client about every species. It also could not tell a journal that
  had not loaded yet from one that had, so an index built in the first seconds
  after login was made entirely of placeholders and stayed cached: every caged
  pet invisible again until something unrelated happened. Both were mine, both
  are fixed, and both are now tested.
- **A quest one objective from done threw away a location you recorded by
  hand.** Last release taught that row to carry coordinates, and asked the raw
  game call â€” which is only the first of four places the addon looks. The
  curated turn-in spot, your own `/cn where` override and the shipped database
  were all discarded, because this row wins against the quest tracker's own
  and the merge never combines coordinates.
- **A quest on another continent was priced as if it were in this zone.** The
  game answers "this map, no exact point" as a normal result, and the router
  prices that correctly â€” but the new code only asked when it had an exact
  point, and fell through to the near cost. Thirty-two points of advantage, on
  a scale where finishing something is worth four: the exact symptom last
  release's note claims to have removed.
- **`/cn achievescan` and the window's achievement button reported a refused
  scan as a success**, printing confident counts over a store that recorded
  nothing while the login reminder went on nagging. `/cn scanlore` was given
  this message three releases ago and the button beside this one two releases
  ago; this was the third caller.
- **`/cn setup` told you to retry with the wrong command.** Its "the game was
  not ready yet" line named the quest-achievement scan for every step, because
  that was the only step that could reach it â€” until last release made the
  achievement scan reachable too.

## [0.86.0]

**`/cn selftest` has been reporting a red FAIL on every Retail client since
the check was written.** Its first line compares a generated list of every
client function the addon mentions against what the client actually has â€” and
that list cannot tell a function the addon *needs* from one it asks about and
takes the other branch when it is absent. Five are the second kind, including
the pre-Dragonflight options API that no Retail client has had for two years.
So the command the bug-report template asks you to run opened with a failure,
under a footer reading *"A failure above is a real defect."* â€” and, being
always red, hid the real API loss it exists to catch.

This release audits the addon's core logic, which had not been swept for many
releases, and four of the six findings were things that had never once worked.

### Fixed

- **`/cn selftest` passes on a healthy client.** The five functions the addon
  only probes for are named as optional, and the count says how many were
  actually required.
- **A caged battle pet in your bags has never been detected.** The lookup that
  turns a caged pet into a species read past the end of what the client
  returns, and fell back to a *different* kind of id â€” one the addon's own code
  lists as a separate field two lines away. So no `/cn bags` row, no
  recommendation, and no tooltip line, for the single clearest example in that
  module's own description. The offline fixture returned two values the client
  does not return, so the only path that runs in the game had never been tested.
- **A quest one objective from finishing was priced as if it were in your
  pocket** â€” and, being priced that way, was treated as having no location at
  all. That row wins against the quest tracker's own, so it also *replaced*
  the real coordinates with none: a quest three feathers from done outranked
  everything in front of you and then could not be navigated to.
- **`/cn setup` reported a cold achievement scan as a success.** The check for
  "the game was not ready yet" read the wrong number for that step â€” a
  four-figure count that is never zero â€” so setup run in the first seconds
  after login said "complete" over a store that had recorded nothing, and
  `/cn setup check` then said "Not scanned yet". Fixed for the sibling scan
  three releases ago and not carried across.
- **A fresh character was nagged to scan for ever.** The achievement scan
  decided whether the client had answered by counting rows *with progress* â€” so
  a character with none looked identical to a client that refused. Nothing was
  stored, the scan never marked itself done, and no command could clear the
  reminder.
- **`/cn selftest` could report PASS one session and FAIL the next** on an
  unchanged account: one check sampled whichever achievements the table
  happened to yield first.
- **Every spellcast by every unit around you was being processed.** The addon's
  one unit event was registered for all units rather than for you â€” in a raid,
  a hundred dispatches a second for a flag that changes once per hearthstone.
- Five of six per-type timing values had been unreachable since a gate added
  three releases later; the table now holds only what can be read.

## [0.85.0]

**Last release made the window taller, and at the largest text size it no
longer fitted on the screen.** 560 pixels at Size 1.50 is 840 units against a
768-unit screen, and the "keep me on screen" flag cannot help with a frame
bigger than the screen â€” it pins one edge and lets the other hang off. So
either the footer and the answer line, or the title bar and its close button,
went past the edge and could not be reached; and because the window remembers
where it was, so did that. At the old height the same sum came to 720 and
fitted, which is why it had never happened before. The size you ask for is now
honoured as far as the screen allows and no further.

Everything in this release is something 0.84.0 broke or left half-done.

### Fixed

- **The window fits the screen at every size it offers.** See above.
- **The Goals tab threw an error on every refresh if one module was missing.**
  Last release's rewrite of that tab replaced a line that was doing double
  duty as a guard, and the `if` beneath it stopped guarding anything â€” so an
  addon that loaded without its chase module printed a Lua error to chat each
  time the window refreshed, instead of degrading quietly. The suite now
  sweeps every tab against every module being absent, because the next rewrite
  will drop a different guard.
- **One keystroke undid last release's "a broken tab does not offer a remedy
  that cannot work" fix.** The replacement sentence was swapped in, drawn, and
  swapped straight back out â€” and typing in the search box redraws from the
  same rows, after the swap has been undone. So "This part of the addon did
  not load" went back to sitting over "Log in on another character and this
  fills itself" as soon as you typed anything.
- **`/cn pins refresh` still reported the capped number as the total** â€”
  "Redrew 40 stops." for a route with sixty-three in it. Last release fixed
  the branch twenty-five lines below it in the same command and not this one.
- **The version and studio line ran underneath the Debug checkbox and the
  Reset button.** Last release moved that checkbox onto a row it described as
  empty; the line along the bottom of the tab is anchored to exactly that row
  and grows leftward without limit, further at every text size above 100%.
- **"Keep the filter box across tabs" was drawn across the checkboxes in the
  next column** at any text size above 100%. The layout check added last
  release measures the settings column downward and has no sideways
  dimension; it does now.

## [0.84.0]

**The "Debug output" checkbox could not be clicked.** The Settings tab's right
column is one chain of anchored controls, and two settings added a while back
pushed it past the bottom of the panel: "Text 100%" was drawn on top of the
Debug checkbox â€” and a button takes the mouse, so the one control this addon
tells you to turn on when reporting a bug was unreachable. "Keep the filter box
across tabs" was drawn below the window entirely, over the game world. The file
records fixing this same overflow twice before; three times is a rule, so the
build now walks the column arithmetically and fails if it does not fit.

This release audits the parts of the addon you actually look at â€” the window,
the map pins and the goal plan â€” which had not been swept in five releases.

### Fixed

- **The Settings tab's right column fits inside the panel**, and the two size
  controls sit side by side, which is where they belonged anyway.
- **Reopening the window greeted you with an old answer.** Press "Scan
  everything", read "Read 6 collections.", close the window, come back twenty
  minutes later â€” and that sentence was still under the tab strip describing
  something that had not just happened. The code that clears it was written
  into a function nothing in the addon calls; every real way of opening the
  window took a different path.
- **The Goals tab told you to switch to the character who already has it.**
  For a recipe or a title the named character is the *holder* â€” a title cannot
  be earned twice â€” and the plan drew "Best character: Bob" under a goal Bob
  had finished. `/cn goals` printed the reason beside it and contradicted
  itself in one line. `/cn alts` was fixed for this five releases ago; this
  was its sibling.
- **Scanning quests could never clear its own "stale" mark.** The Scans tab
  caches its rows against a counter that every other scan moves, and this one
  deliberately does not use that path â€” so clicking the row froze the client,
  did the work, and changed nothing on screen. The Collections tab, reading
  the same timestamp uncached, said "just now" at the same moment.
- **`/cn find` wrote to your saved data.** Searching refreshes every tab with
  the window hidden so there are rows to match, and one of those tabs walked
  the quest pins on your map and filed each one â€” pins you never saw,
  evicting real observations at the store's cap.
- **The map dropped stops past forty and said nothing**, and `/cn pins`
  reported the truncated number as the total. It now says how many it did not
  draw â€” the rule this addon applies to every other truncated list.
- **A tab whose module failed to load offered a remedy that cannot work** â€”
  "This part of the addon did not load" over "Nothing pinned yet; pin
  something." Four tabs did this; the Zone tab had been fixed for it alone.
- **Unticking "Move the waypoint on as I finish things" left its timer
  running** for the rest of the session, and ticking it did nothing visible
  until the next event â€” while `/cn auto`, which writes the same setting, did
  both properly.
- **"Rescan currencies" froze the client and said nothing.** Every other scan
  button in the window reports what it read; this one threw all three numbers
  away, so a scan the client refused looked exactly like one that worked.
- **The Scans tab's own note was printed across the bottom row of its list.**

## [0.83.0]

**Last release made the mail reminder hideable, and `/cn hidden` then called
it "Currency mail".** That list names each row through a lookup whose every
branch starts by converting the id to a number â€” so a row identified by a word
falls past all of them to a last-resort line that prints the addon's own
internals. A table of names exists for exactly this and had two entries in it;
0.82.0 added a third such row without adding it there, and two more had been
missing the whole time. The list now reads:

> Expiring mail Â· Your Mythic+ keystone Â· Great Vault: raid progress

and a sweep over every row the addon can produce fails the build if a new one
arrives without a name.

### Fixed

- **Five rows were named after the addon's internals in `/cn hidden`** â€” the
  mail reminder, the keystone row, and the Great Vault's four progress rows.
- **A crafting order could be mistaken for a recipe you already know.**
  "Recipe" covers three unrelated kinds of number: a merchant's item id, a
  trade-skill recipe id, and a crafting order id. 0.82.0 moved the vendor rows
  out of the collision and left the crafting orders in it, so an order whose
  number happened to match a recipe you know was reported as already done and
  the waypoint was silently dropped â€” from an order about to expire, which is
  the only reason that row exists. Orders now carry their own id space.
- **Importing a quest chain could delete an observation you made yourself.**
  Both the importer and your own quest-chain harvest write into the same
  graph, and the importer wrote last â€” so an import made mid-session took over
  a chain you had observed on three of your own characters, and
  `/cn contribute forget` then removed it as though it had been imported. A
  quest the addon had correctly held as locked became available, and `/cn go`
  would route you to a quest giver who would not talk to you. Your own
  observations are republished after a forget.
- **Last release's cleanup reached the smaller half of the reputation store.**
  Most factions are not account-wide, so most reputation rows live on the
  character rather than on the account, and the migration only walked the
  account half. Every earlier cleanup of this kind was for an account-only
  store, and this one inherited the shape without inheriting the question. Its
  own test could not see it: the fixture had no characters in it.
- **The 0.82.0 notes named the wrong command.** The specialization line is in
  `/cn warband`, not `/cn who`.

## [0.82.0]

**The mail reminder could not be dismissed.** It carries the highest fixed
value of anything in its file, so it sat at the top of `/cn next` â€” and the
provider that builds it skipped the hide-and-defer checks its two neighbouring
loops apply. Pressing **Ignore** said *"Ignored: 3 mail expiring"*, wrote the
entry, listed it in `/cn hidden`, and put the row straight back on the next
refresh. Defer was equally inert. This is a sweep release: it audits code that
had not been revised in fifteen to thirty releases.

### Fixed

- **The mail row can be hidden and deferred**, like everything else. The suite
  now checks every single-row provider rather than the three that were known.
- **A vendor-sold recipe could retire your waypoint.** 0.81.0 fixed how that
  provider *finds* a recipe and stopped one function short: the row it built
  still carried the merchant's item id as its identity, and the code that
  decides whether something is already done looks that id up in a table keyed
  by trade-skill recipe ids. On a collision it answered "already known" and
  the arrow silently gave up on a recipe you had not bought, naming an
  unrelated one as the reason.
- **`/cn contribute forget` did not forget.** It cleared the stored chains and
  left the dependency graph they had been published into â€” so every quest they
  named stayed locked, still explained as *"from an imported chain, not from
  your own play"*, until you reloaded.
- **Your own observations were being credited to somebody else's import.**
  Both the importer and your own quest-chain harvest write into the same
  graph, and only the importer stamped where its data came from â€” so a quest
  seen on three of your own characters was reported as imported. That is the
  one distinction the import feature calls its whole safety model.
- **`/cn capture` could manufacture the defect it exists to catch.** The
  map-span capture ignored the flag saying the client had refused to answer,
  and recorded the refusal's placeholder â€” "this map is one yard square" â€” as
  a successful measurement, in the file you paste into a bug report. The
  refusal happens during a loading screen, which is exactly when someone runs
  that command.
- **Titles printed with the client's padding.** The game returns them padded
  for concatenation â€” `" the Explorer"` â€” and one of the two places that read
  a title trimmed it while the other, which is the one everything now uses,
  did not. The addon was matching one string and showing another.
- **A faction gate was the one untranslated word on the screen.** `/cn why` on
  a faction-locked quest printed "Alliance only" on a German client, three
  lines under a correctly translated class list.
- **`/cn petscan`'s three numbers did not add up** â€” unobtainable species were
  counted in the total and in neither figure beneath it. `/cn sets` said
  "1 sets read" and "1 activities".

### Changed

- **`/cn warband` shows each character's specialization.** The addon has been
  recording it since 0.62.0 and never once displaying it. It is stored as the
  game's own id now rather than as a word, so it reads in your language rather
  than in whichever language the alt was levelled in.
- **Roughly nine hundred mount rows, and every reputation row, stopped
  carrying timestamps nothing reads** â€” written on every login and saved on
  every logout since the stores were created. Two earlier cleanups removed the
  same field from five other stores and missed these two. Existing saved data
  is cleaned up once, on login.

## [0.81.0]

**Being inside an instance is a fact about the doorway, not about the
company.** 0.80.0 correctly stopped calling a solo raid clear "an instance
with a group" â€” and in doing so left the other half of the question unasked.
Standing inside anything, alone or not, a herb in Durotar is not something you
can go and do; it is something you can do after a loading screen. So a player
soloing Firelands could be handed an outdoor world quest as the best next
thing, and `/cn plan` would lay out a walking route they could not start.

The addon now ranks by **where a thing is**, not by what type it is. Inside an
instance, anything with a known location that is not in here with you is ranked
down and says so. Anything that is in here â€” or that has no location at all,
like the mount off the last boss â€” is left exactly where it was. That is a
better rule than the old list of types in both directions: the old one buried
the mount you came for and said nothing about the quest three zones away.

### Fixed

- **A solo instance run no longer recommends outdoor work**, and `/cn plan`
  refuses with the reason rather than a generic shrug. `/cn situation` now has
  something to say about being inside on your own.
- **Vendor-sold recipes have never been found.** That provider matched a
  merchant's item id against a table keyed by trade-skill recipe ids â€” two
  unrelated number spaces â€” so it produced a row only where the two numbers
  happened to collide by accident. Every real vendor-sold recipe was invisible,
  and each coincidence was a ranked row named after an unrelated recipe with
  directions to a vendor selling something else. This is the same collision
  0.80.0 removed from the tooltip; it had a sibling and nobody looked.
- **`/cn drops` could answer "nothing" for a minute at a time.** 0.80.0 began
  remembering searches that found nothing, to stop tooltips hammering the
  Adventure Guide â€” and recorded three different things as one: a search that
  found nothing, a search that had not finished yet (the client's is
  asynchronous, so the first one never has), and a search that never ran
  because the Adventure Guide was open. Only the first is remembered now.
- **0.81.0's own first attempt compared the wrong maps.** It asked whether two
  things were in the same *zone*, and most modern instance maps sit inside
  their outdoor zone â€” so the world quest on the other side of the door
  compared equal and nothing outside was ranked down at all. It compares
  instance identity now, which also means two floors of one dungeon are one
  place.
- **A loading screen no longer ranks down everything the addon can locate.**
  The client reports no map for a moment on every zone change, which is exactly
  when the ranking is rebuilt. "I don't know yet" is not "outside".

## [0.80.0]

**If you solo old raids for mounts, this release is for you.** The addon has
been quietly demoting mounts, pets, toys, appearances, rares, treasures,
vendors and recipes by 65% whenever you were inside an instance â€” including
when you were in there completely alone. Soloing old content is how almost all
of those are farmed, so the addon was burying the exact thing you had walked in
for, and explaining it with "you are in an instance with a group" to a player
with nobody else there. `/cn situation` said so out loud: *"You are in a
instance with 0 people."* The group check the design always described is now
actually made.

This release audits code that had not been touched in fifteen to thirty
releases, rather than the code the last one changed.

### Fixed

- **Soloing an instance no longer demotes what you went in for.** See above.
  A real group still does. `/cn situation` also says "an instance" rather than
  "a instance", which it had been printing since 0.44.0.
- **Tooltips claimed ordinary items were recipes.** The recipe lookup indexed
  a table keyed by trade-skill recipe ids using an *item* id â€” two unrelated
  number spaces â€” so any item whose id happened to collide with a captured
  recipe got "Recipe: not known by this character" and a list of which of your
  alts know it. On a stack of ore. It also reported the collision as an *exact*
  match, which suppressed the "matched by name" caveat that would have warned
  you.
- **The tooltip's appearance line has never once worked.** It looked
  appearances up by item id; every appearance this addon tracks is keyed by
  gear slot or by a set id. The lookup could not match, and cost a full
  recommendation walk on every gear mouseover to arrive at nothing. The
  appearance *collected / not collected* line, which reads the client directly,
  was never affected and still works.
- **Hovering a bag of collectibles hammered the Adventure Guide.** The
  "Drops from" lookup remembered answers and never remembered *misses*, on the
  reasoning that a repeat search only costs something when a player asks for
  one. That stopped being true when tooltips became a caller: most items are
  not boss drops, so the common case was the uncached one, and sweeping a loot
  window or auction-house page re-ran a full journal search â€” with a save and
  restore of the Adventure Guide's own selection â€” dozens of times a second.
- **Rare alerts ran a full sweep on every minimap update.** `Rares.lua` has a
  comment naming this exact handler as the one it could not throttle from
  where it sat. Nineteen releases later, it is throttled. With alerts on,
  flying across a zone with rares up was running a client call and two table
  allocations per rare, several times a second.
- **`/cn locale` contradicted itself on English clients.** It said the addon
  is written in English so there is nothing to translate, and then reported
  that N strings had "fallen back to English this session" and that the list
  "is exactly what a translator needs". `/cn locale missing` then printed the
  addon's entire vocabulary as untranslated work.
- **Appearance rows carried a timestamp nothing reads.** An earlier release
  stripped exactly this field from four other stores for exactly this reason
  and missed this one; its writer was never changed either, so a strip alone
  would not have held. Both ends are fixed, and existing saved data is cleaned
  up on login.
- **Nothing ever cleared the cached drop answers.** The function to do it was
  written with the cache and called from nowhere. It runs on a world change
  now, which is when the journal's own context changes underneath it.

## [0.79.0]

**If `/cn go` has been printing `table: 0x0000...` at you, that is fixed.**
0.78.0 started showing the note a waypoint provider attaches to a success â€”
"the arrow is set; the game does not allow a map pin here" â€” and TomTom was
handing back its internal waypoint handle in that slot instead of a sentence.
Every player using TomTom saw the handle. The contract now refuses anything
that is not a sentence, so a provider that gets this wrong in future prints
nothing rather than gibberish.

### Fixed â€” 0.78.0's own damage

- **`/cn go` printed an internal handle under every waypoint.** See above.
- **`/cn arrow on` left the arrow frozen where it was.** 0.78.0 stopped the
  redraw when the arrow was switched off â€” correctly â€” and never started it
  again when it was switched back on. The arrow appeared, pointed at whatever
  direction it had last been given, and stayed there.
- **A rare the client had stopped reporting was still offered.** 0.78.0 gave
  treasures an eligibility check and left out the liveness test, which removed
  the fallback that had been catching this. A despawned rare now reads "Not up
  right now" instead of being routed to.
- **Riding past the same corpse three times counted as three encounters.**
  0.78.0 switched the vignette walk to the unfiltered list so the "already
  dead" flag would survive, and went on recording dead rows as sightings â€”
  a number `/cn goal` shows you.

### Fixed â€” code untouched for many releases

- **Four of the six places that set a waypoint said nothing at all.** The
  Goals tab's "Next step" button produced no chat output whatsoever, a world
  map pin click was silent, and a follow-mode hub advance inside an instance
  both failed to place the pin and never mentioned it. All six now go through
  one function, so a headline and its caveat cannot drift apart again. Follow
  mode still does not narrate â€” it reports a refusal and nothing else.
- **`/cn alts` told you to switch to a character that had already done it.**
  For recipes and titles the named character is the one who *holds* it, and a
  title cannot be earned twice. The list read "already knows it: Bob, Carol"
  underneath "Bob could do 2 of these". It also listed quests as switchable
  when nothing in the addon knows which character a quest belongs to.
- **A ticking deadline made every row a different row.** A countdown was part
  of what the scorer used to decide whether two recommendations were the same
  thing, so one second of elapsed time re-listed the whole board. Deadlines
  now agree if they are within a minute of each other.
- **Flying across eight zones ran eight full recommendation passes**, and
  re-pointed the waypoint at zones being flown over. Mass-looting a bag of
  pets did the same. Neither happens now, and a quest turn-in is still
  answered the moment it lands.
- **A cross-tab count could promise more rows than the tab showed.** The
  search counted matching rows while a tab keeps whole blocks, so "Also on:
  Goals (2)" opened a tab with eight rows in it. Both numbers come from the
  same place now.
- **`/cn currency` dumped every capped currency into chat.** 0.78.0 capped the
  weekly half of that command at eight rows and left the other half unbounded.
- **`/cn hidden` named two rows after the addon's internals.** The Great
  Vault and finished-crafting-order rows use word ids rather than numbers, and
  the last-resort namer produced "CURRENCY vault". Hiding either one now shows
  what it is, and the choice survives the rename from the old numeric id.
- **A currency breakdown row said "N collected" about a cap.** It now says
  "not at cap", which is what the number counts.
- **Three providers subscribed to constantly-firing events with no throttle** â€”
  the same defect fixed for one file in 0.78.0, left standing in three others.

## [0.78.0]

**Last release's headline fix reached nobody.** The migration that was meant
to clear the broken frame positions looked in `db.account.settings` â€” a table
this addon does not have. Settings live at `db.settings`. So it ran, found
nothing, stamped itself done, and every position saved in the broken shape
survived and was restored against the same wrong anchor. If the heads-up box
still would not stay where you put it after 0.77.0, that is why. The real
reset runs now.

### Fixed â€” 0.77.0's own damage

- **The window filter stopped matching numbers.** 0.77.0 ran the name-cleaning
  function over the *value* column too, and that function strips leading
  punctuation and digits â€” which is right for a name and destructive for the
  column the numbers live in. "6 left" became "left"; "40 / 60" and "85%"
  became nothing at all. So filtering by any number matched no row, and the
  cross-tab counts were computed from the same erased text â€” the exact
  mismatch that change was written to remove, still there for every numeric
  row.
- **`/cn travel`'s walking comparison was never marked as an estimate.** The
  confidence helper compares against named levels and was handed a raw
  boolean, which matches neither â€” so it returned the *measured* form always,
  in the one line whose comment says a measured figure and a default are not
  the same claim.
- **The new "no map pin here" caveat printed above its own headline**, and at
  four of six call sites had no headline at all â€” a bare indented sentence
  with nothing over it, on every hub advance in follow mode inside an
  instance.
- **Auto-advance charged players who have it switched off.** The "is this on"
  test sat inside the throttled body, so every minimap vignette still
  allocated a closure and scheduled a timer for the default setting. All eight
  events also shared one throttle, so a quest turn-in arriving mid-burst lost
  its immediate answer â€” on the single moment the feature exists for.

### Fixed â€” code untouched for many releases

- **A rare somebody else killed was recommended for ever.** The client tells
  the addon a rare is dead; the reader both filtered those out *and* dropped
  the flag from the rows it built, so the code that records "seen already
  dead" could never see one. Every clear fell back to a "it vanished within
  150 yards of me" guess, which misses anything finished while you rode past.
- **Turning the arrow off left it redrawing ten times a second** â€” rotation,
  colour and two text updates on a hidden frame, for the rest of the session.
  The close button 0.77.0 added made it trivially easy to hit. `/cd navdiag`
  now reports whether that redraw is running.
- **Hiding or deferring the Great Vault claim did nothing.** Both "collect
  your free thing" rows skipped the hide-and-defer checks their own
  neighbouring loops apply, so right-clicking one said "Deferred for an hour"
  and it was back on the next refresh. The vault row's id was `0`, which the
  addon's own parser rejects, so `/cn unhide` could not name it back either.
- **Treasures could not be explained.** The module emits rares and treasures
  from one store and only rares had an eligibility rule, so half its rows
  answered "unknown" â€” `/cn why` said nothing useful and the auto-advance
  staleness test fell through to a full scan every time.
- **Every coin picked up rebuilt the currency recommendations.** That event
  fires constantly, which is why the *scan* behind it is throttled to a
  minute; the rebuild was not throttled at all.
- **`/cn currencies` announced fourteen weekly rows and showed eight**, with
  nothing to say it had stopped. `/cn travel`'s teleport list did the same at
  five.
- **"Route complete. 12 stops, all done."** was still half-translated after
  the release that fixed the plural and cited the half-translation as the
  defect. Both halves are translatable keys now, and so is the heads-up
  line's "stop N of M".
- **The close button's footprint was defined in two files**, and the two
  frames that gained one in 0.77.0 reserved no room for it â€” so the right end
  of the follow header was a live click that stopped the route, with nothing
  drawn there.
- **`/cn uistatus` reported the minimap angle in radians.** It is degrees, and
  the default is 225, so it printed "225.00 rad" â€” thirty-five full turns.
- Plus: the arrow wrote an empty table into saved data on every first build,
  and a lifetime turn-in counter was incremented for ever and read by nothing.

## [0.77.0]

**The heads-up box drags and then does not stay â€” this fixes that, and gives
the follow list and the arrow the same close button the heads-up line already
had.** Three of the four movable frames saved their position without the
corner they were anchored *to*, so when that differed from the anchor itself
the offsets came back applied against a different corner of the screen and the
frame reappeared somewhere the player never put it. One function now, used by
all four.

### Fixed â€” data loss in both scans, from last release

- **A half-warm client deleted every row in the categories that stayed
  quiet.** 0.76.0 added a prune to the zone and achievement scans, gated on a
  whole-store counter â€” and both walks are *per category*. So the ordinary
  case, where one expansion answers and three do not, deleted every row in the
  three, taking every character's readings with them. A row is only a
  candidate for deletion when the category it belongs to answered.

### Added â€” a way out of every frame drawn over the world

- **The follow list and the arrow now have a hover x and a tooltip**, the same
  control the heads-up line got when you asked for one. The follow frame could
  previously only be dismissed by knowing `/cn follow`, and the arrow ate world
  clicks in its own footprint with nothing on screen explaining why.
- **`/cn uistatus` no longer throws away your window position.** Running the
  diagnostic while the window happened to be closed â€” its state most of the
  time â€” silently discarded a position you had set, recentred the window and
  forced it open. It reports now, and offers `/cn uistatus reset` as the
  repair. It also shows the relative anchor, which is the field the bug above
  was hiding in.

### Fixed â€” features that never worked

- **`/cn bags` has never once reported a carried recipe.** The class id was
  read one position short of where the client returns it, so the variable held
  an icon file id and the test against "recipe" was never true on any client.
  The whole feature, dead in one missing placeholder.
- **`/cn travel` quoted "running the whole way" at flying speed** â€” it asked
  for the speed of whatever you are doing *now*, and anyone reading that
  command is normally mounted. A fifty-minute walk read as fourteen minutes,
  which makes the flight the line exists to justify look like a bad idea.
- **A waypoint set on a dungeon or raid map said "Waypoint set" and showed no
  map pin.** The sentence explaining why was composed by the provider and then
  discarded, because the caller read it only on failure.

### Fixed â€” search, and things shown to the player

- **The cross-tab search and the tab's own filter asked different
  questions.** The "Also on:" counts searched the raw text, colour codes
  included, so typing any hex fragment reported a match on every row of every
  tab and none where you were standing â€” and a term that appeared only in the
  right-hand column was counted and then not found when you clicked through.
- **Bank ages were printed in raw hours**: "seen 336h ago" for a bank read a
  fortnight before.
- **Nine commands padded their columns with spaces.** WoW ships no monospace
  chat font, so that produces a ragged edge that reads as a bug rather than a
  table â€” the rule this addon states in two places and fixed in the window,
  while the chat side kept it. `/cn elsewhere` was the worst: a day-to-day
  command whose names are long enough to wrap mid-row. A build check now fails
  on a new one.
- **"Route complete. 1 stops, everything on it done."** â€” unpluralised, and an
  English literal bolted onto a translated headline.
- **`/cn mode <profile>` answered with no headline**, so its two lines arrived
  as orphan text in the middle of the chat frame.

### Fixed â€” cost, and two rules written twice

- **Auto-advance ran on every minimap vignette.** That event fires many times
  a second while moving through any zone with rares in it â€” which is exactly
  when auto-waypoint is on â€” and each firing ran a linear scan of the whole
  candidate list and a full re-rank with the recommendation hooks live. It is
  throttled now, like the three other firehose events in the addon.
- **The window's refresh subscription was not idempotent** while its sibling
  was, so a late-registered provider would have added another forty redraw
  handlers each time.
- **`/cn why` rebuilt the ranking weights by hand** â€” in the one function whose
  own header promises it does the same arithmetic the scorer does.

## [0.76.0]

**Two of last release's fixes destroyed the data they were written to
protect.** Both were mine. If you upgraded through 0.75.0 and ran an
achievement scan on an alt, or ran one in the first seconds after logging in,
this is the release that stops it and tells you what to do about it.

### Fixed â€” data loss in the achievement scan

- **A scan on an alt deleted every achievement row the main had progress
  on.** 0.75.0 replaced a store wipe with a prune, and marked a row as "still
  exists" only inside the branch that stored it â€” a branch gated on *this*
  character's progress. So on a fresh alt, nearly every row was neither stored
  nor marked, and the prune deleted it, taking the main's readings with it.
  That is exactly the loss the wipe was removed to prevent, brought back in a
  different shape. A row is now marked when the game returns it, which is what
  the prune was ever about.
- **A scan run before the game was ready overwrote real criteria with
  zeroes** and then pruned everything it had not confirmed. The criteria API
  answers `0, 0` while the client is still loading, and `/cn setup` is most
  often run exactly then. Two sibling scans have carried this guard since
  0.61.0 and 0.71.0; this third writer had none. A scan that read nothing now
  changes nothing.

### Fixed â€” the upgrade that silently emptied your recommendations

0.75.0's migration cleared the old shared criteria field, correctly â€” but for
an upgrading account that field was the only figure nearly every row had, so
the achievement shortlist, `/cn next`'s achievement rows and every goal plan
went empty at once, with nothing to say why and nothing that would fix it on
its own.

- **The addon now says so**, and names the command that repairs it.
- **A character that has not read its own progress is asked to.** 0.75.0 added
  the function for this and never called it, so the store behind it was
  written and read by nothing. Setup judged the two per-character scans by an
  account-wide stamp, so a main that had run setup silenced the prompt for
  every alt that never had.

### Fixed â€” the zone learner, which could not learn and could learn wrongly

- **It only ever refreshed the winner's baseline.** The other candidate's
  reading went stale the moment you quested there and stayed stale â€” so on the
  next criteria update it read above its own baseline and counted as a second
  mover, and nothing was ever learned. For the player who works both Nagrands,
  which is the only player it was written for, the mechanism was dead. Worse,
  a criteria update from anywhere â€” a pet battle, a raid â€” could find only the
  stale row above its baseline and bind a phantom. A comparison is only
  evidence against a baseline something maintains; it maintains one now.
- **It ran a per-criterion sweep on every criteria burst.** Every modern zone
  has at least two candidates, so this asked the game a hundred-odd questions
  every two seconds while questing, to re-derive an answer that changes at
  most once per zone. It stops when there is nothing left to learn, and is
  throttled otherwise.
- **And a turn-in still reports that it moved something.** The learning pass
  writes fresh readings back, so it had to be ordered after the reading that
  decides whether anything changed â€” otherwise the invalidation that carries a
  turn-in into the ranking would have been permanently silent.

### Fixed â€” a workaround, by removing what it worked around

- **The zone store never deleted anything.** An achievement retired in a game
  patch kept its row for the life of the account, and the client will never
  name it again â€” which is the single reason 0.75.0 had to invent a table of
  "rows the client has ever named" and a rule about which walk may settle. That
  rule was itself wrong: two lookups inside one cold window marked the whole
  store retired and then cached a list with the zone's own achievement
  missing, for the rest of the session. Rows the game no longer returns are
  deleted now, the exact test is back, and the workaround is gone.

### Fixed â€” smaller, all user-facing

- **The cold-scan retry announced the rows it walked past, not the rows it
  read** â€” "412" for a scan that read 40. The same mistake fixed at
  `/cn scanlore` in 0.72.0 and at the Rescan button in 0.74.0, in a third
  place one release later.
- **`/cn errors` told you to clear a notice and then refused to.** Reading it
  in the command did not count as having seen it, and only seen notices were
  cleared â€” so you got "Cleared 0 recorded errors" and the notice came back
  twelve seconds later at login. Printing it counts now.
- **A database that lost nothing was told it had.** The friendship-rank notice
  fired for accounts that upgraded through the *corrected* migration and never
  lost anything.
- **`/cn zones forget` counted achievements and called them zones** â€” three
  learned in one zone read as "Forgot 3 learned zones" â€” and said "Forgot 0"
  when there had never been anything to forget.

## [0.75.0]

**Last release's zone binding had the relation the wrong way round, and the
per-character split it claimed to add never took effect.** Both were mine, and
both are corrected here.

### Fixed â€” the zone binding, inverted

0.74.0 stored *zone â†’ achievement* and let a binding **promote** that
achievement above every other rule. Its guard was "more than one candidate" â€”
and this addon's own notes say every modern zone has at least two, its story
achievement and its "Sojourner of <Zone>" companion. So the learning path ran
everywhere, and the first quest of either kind bound the zone to whichever it
happened to be. Once a bound Sojourner was earned, the Journey tab's "Here"
row read green at 24/24 for ever while the zone's Loremaster achievement sat
unmentioned at 30 of 60, and the zone stopped producing recommendations
entirely.

- **The relation is now the true one: an achievement belongs to a zone.**
  Stored that way it *excludes* rather than promotes â€” a candidate known to
  belong to a different zone is not a candidate here â€” and everything else is
  left to the ordering that was already correct. A binding learned in an
  ordinary zone can do no harm at all, by construction rather than by a guard.
- **What 0.74.0 called evidence was not.** It compared the live figure against
  a function that answers zero for any row this character has never scanned,
  and `CRITERIA_UPDATE` fires globally â€” for a pet battle, a raid criterion,
  anything. A character holding progress in Outland's Nagrand, standing in
  Draenor's, bound the wrong zone permanently on the next criteria update
  anywhere. A candidate now counts only when this character has a recorded
  reading for it and the live figure is *higher*.
- **`/cn zones forget` exists.** 0.74.0 published a clearing function with a
  comment saying it was there so `/cn reset` could call it â€” there is no
  `/cn reset` in this addon and nothing called it, so a wrong binding was
  permanent. Bindings also re-learn from newer evidence, and a binding to an
  achievement the game has retired is dropped by the next scan.

### Fixed â€” the per-character achievement split, which was inert

0.74.0 added a `progress` table keyed by character and then never wrote it:
the scan built a fresh table literal that bypassed the writer, and the writer
went on setting the flat field the split was meant to retire. So the defect it
was written to fix â€” an alt reading the main's criteria count, being told it
was two criteria from finishing, and being sent across the world for it â€” was
still shipping.

- The scan writes through the one writer, and **no longer wipes the account
  store**, which destroyed every other character's readings on every
  `/cn achievescan`.
- The scan is recorded per character, so an alt is prompted to read its own
  progress instead of silently inheriting.
- Two readers 0.74.0 missed: the "closest to completion" sort was ordered by
  one character's numbers while printing another's, and a pinned achievement
  goal reported whichever character scanned last.

### Fixed â€” caching, where two guards were set wrong in opposite directions

- **One retired achievement disabled the zone cache for the life of the
  account.** The scan only ever writes rows, so an achievement retired in a
  patch keeps its row and the client never names it again â€” which made
  0.74.0's "every row answered" test permanently false and the index
  permanently empty. Every lookup then paid the full store walk the cache
  exists to avoid. Rows the client has never answered for are now excluded
  from the test, and the walk that *discovers* a refusal is deliberately not
  trusted, in case the refused row was the one that mattered.
- **A dungeon evicted the answer for the zone around it.** Most instances
  parent into their outdoor zone, so the map id says one thing and the zone
  name another; 0.74.0 filed under the map id and rejected on mismatch, so
  every lookup inside missed *and* overwrote the outdoor entry, and walking
  back out missed and re-stamped. The key carries both now.
- **A map lookup the client refused was cached as an answer**, pinning a
  building to itself for the rest of the session.
- **The criteria refresh walked the store twice per burst** â€” once purely to
  populate two variables â€” inside a two-second debounce while questing.

### Fixed â€” what the addon tells you

- **`/cn errors` contradicted itself two lines apart**, printing a red notice
  and then "Nothing has gone wrong this session", and the notice could never
  be cleared. It now reads correctly and `/cn errors clear` removes notices
  you have already seen.
- **The one-time notice about data 0.72.0 destroyed was printed into the login
  chatter and marked as seen on the way past** â€” the one chance to read it was
  the one moment nobody reads. It is delayed now, the way the setup reminder
  already was.
- **That notice's number counted this character too**, whose ranks were about
  to be restored seconds later. A wrong number in the one message whose entire
  purpose is honesty about data loss.
- **The cold-scan retry died silently after three attempts anywhere in a
  session** â€” trivially reached by following the addon's own advice â€” and said
  nothing when it succeeded. A scan you asked for is a fresh start now, and a
  successful retry says so and redraws.

## [0.74.0]

**The 0.73.0 zone fix could not fire.** It broke the tie between two zones
sharing a name by comparing the achievement's category with the continent you
are standing on â€” on the premise that a quest category is a continent. On
retail it is an *expansion*: "Warlords of Draenor" is never equal to
"Draenor", "Burning Crusade" is never equal to "Outland". Neither side ever
matched, in any of the cases the release was written for. It was also two
localized strings deciding a branch, which this addon has a standing rule
against, in the one place the rule warns about.

### Fixed â€” zone identity, from evidence instead of inference

- **Two zones with one name are now told apart by what actually moved.** When
  your criteria on exactly one candidate change while you are standing in a
  zone, that candidate is that zone's achievement â€” nothing else can produce
  that. The binding is learned, filed under the zone's own map id, and
  outranks every other rule. Two candidates moving at once teaches nothing,
  because it is not evidence about either. Until the evidence arrives the
  ordering is unchanged: deterministic, stable, and occasionally wrong about
  which Nagrand you meant â€” which is honest, and stops being true the first
  time you hand a quest in there.
- **The zone walk asked the client for every name twice.** 0.73.0's
  "did the client answer" counter asked for the name, then asked again through
  the naming function â€” doubling the cost of the walk this file calls the
  whole expense.
- **A half-awake client's walk was remembered as though it were an answer.**
  The test was "did the client name *anything*", which waves through the case
  that actually happens: some rows resolve, the zone's own does not, and a
  wrong answer is cached. It is now "did the client answer for every row" â€” a
  partial walk still answers, because a partial list beats a blank tab, but it
  is not committed to memory. That also removed the loading-screen wipe 0.73.0
  added to compensate, which paid for a full store walk on every portal,
  hearth and boat.
- **Asking about a room inside a zone blanked the zone.** The cache key came
  from the map and the value from the name, and nothing checked they described
  the same place.
- **The map ancestry is walked once per map instead of once per question.**
  Each walk is up to eight client calls that each allocate a table, and it ran
  from the two-second tab refresh and every provider rebuild.

### Fixed â€” the sibling that has had this defect since 0.62.0

- **Exploration bound the wrong continent's record and then wrote your
  progress into it.** It learned its zone key from `GetBestMapForUnit` â€” the
  building you are standing in â€” and learned it from an unordered walk that
  returned whichever of two same-named zones came back first. That record then
  received this character's progress and the account's earned flag. It now
  learns the *zone*, and refuses to learn anything when more than one
  achievement matches.

### Fixed â€” scope, which is where three defects were hiding

- **Logging in on your main erased the quest pins your alts still needed.**
  The account-wide store of *where a quest is* was being pruned on "is it in
  MY log", and 0.73.0 wired that sweep to every login. Twenty-five quests in
  your log meant twenty-five locations gone for the whole account. Turning a
  quest in now clears its pin only when the *account* has finished it, and
  accepting one no longer clears it at all â€” that was 0.73.0's addition, wrong
  the same way.
- **An alt was told it was two criteria from finishing the main's
  achievements.** Criteria progress is per character and the earned flag is
  account-wide; the two sibling stores were split in 0.61.0 and 0.64.0 with a
  paragraph each explaining why, and this third one was never revisited. It
  drives the shortlist, which drives `/cn next` â€” so an alt at 2 of 40
  inherited 38 of 40 and was sent across the world to finish it.

### Fixed â€” what the addon tells you

- **A scan the game was not ready for now tries again.** 0.73.0 correctly
  stopped it recording itself and left nothing behind it: the store was no
  longer empty, so the "no data yet" path never fired again, and the Journey
  tab stayed blank until the next login. It retries, a bounded number of
  times.
- **`/cn setup` reported a game still loading as a defect** â€” in red, pointing
  at an empty `/cn errors`, and stamping setup complete, which silences the
  login reminder. "Not ready" is now its own state that says to try again.
- **Zones you have never begun no longer fill a list headed "Closest to
  finished."** They have their own section, on the Journey tab and in
  `/cn loremaster`.
- **The addon now says what version 0.72.0 destroyed.** That release's
  migration deleted every friendship rank belonging to a character that was
  not logged in. 0.73.0 fixed the migration for anyone who had not upgraded
  yet and said nothing to those who had. Nothing can bring the data back â€”
  each character restores its own on its next login â€” but the addon owes you
  the sentence, and now prints it once and keeps it in `/cn errors`.
- **The migration ladder had a hole.** 0.73.0 bumped the database version past
  its last migration, so the bump ran nothing. A build check now fails on a
  gap.
- **The tooltip and `/cn list` still described one journey two ways** â€”
  "over 20m away" against "About 20m away at least", which also contradicts
  itself. One stem, two renderings.

## [0.73.0]

**Last release removed the only thing telling the two Nagrands apart.** 0.72.0
was right that the persisted map stamp was broken â€” it came from the map you
are standing *on*, which indoors is a building â€” and wrong to conclude that
the zone name could replace it. Retail ships two zones called Nagrand, two
called Shadowmoon Valley and two called Dalaran. This release asks the client
the question it was actually being asked: not "which map am I standing on" but
"which zone is this", answered by walking up to the first ancestor the client
itself calls a zone.

### Fixed â€” zone identity, for the fourth and last time

- **Standing in Draenor's Nagrand showed progress for Outland's.** The name
  match is right and stays; the ordering now prefers the achievement whose
  category is the continent you are on, and falls through to the previous rule
  whenever the client will not name one. It never decides on a guess.
- **A zone walked while the client was cold stayed empty for the session.**
  Achievement names are asked for, not stored, so in the seconds after a
  loading screen every row resolves to a placeholder and nothing matches â€”
  and 0.72.0 cached that empty result deliberately. The Loremaster provider
  wakes on zone changes, so one badly-timed loading screen silently removed
  the Journey tab's "Here" row, the "This zone" block, the provider's rows and
  the turn-in refresh until the next login. A walk the client refused is no
  longer an answer, and the index is cleared on every loading screen.
- **A scan that measured nothing left the stale index in place**, because the
  invalidation sat below the early return â€” on the one scan most likely to
  have run against a cold client.
- **`ForZone` for an unknown map answered about the zone you are standing
  in.** A nil name fell through to the default.

### Fixed â€” what the addon learns and what it shows

- **Upgrading destroyed every alt's friendship rank.** 0.72.0 wrote a
  paragraph explaining that a friendship's rank is the one standing the client
  will not re-supply for another character, moved it to its own field, and
  then had the migration delete every existing copy. It is carried across now.
  This is a correction to a defect that already shipped: if you upgraded
  through 0.72.0, your alts' friendship ranks are gone and nothing can bring
  them back â€” each character restores its own the next time it logs in.
- **`/cn plan` was being taught that flights are free.** A quest whose map pin
  has not resolved yet reports a map and no point on it, and 0.72.0's test for
  "this row has no place in it" was true for that shape â€” so ten minutes of
  flying plus five of questing was recorded as fifteen minutes of quest work,
  in the highest-volume type feeding the planner's headline figure. Worse, it
  stuck: the estimate is only ever revised downward and zero is the floor.
- **Two lists headed "closest to finished" held rooms for zones never
  begun** â€” three rows of `0 / 120` with an empty bar, displacing three
  genuinely nearly-done zones. The reserve was written for `/cn zones` and
  applied to every caller.
- **`/cn setup` reported a clean bill for a scan that recorded nothing**, and
  stamped setup as complete â€” which silences the login reminder. Setup is most
  often run right after logging in, which is exactly when the game refuses.
  The Journey tab's "Rescan zones" button now says whether it worked, too.
- **An achievement that crossed the "nearly done" boundary still did not reach
  `/cn next`.** 0.72.0 moved that sweep onto the shared throttle so the last
  update in a burst would count; the trailing run then told the shortlist and
  not the ranking, and the ranking had already rebuilt five seconds earlier.
  Both sibling handlers do this correctly.
- **A quest you picked up stayed on the map as one waiting to be picked up.**
  0.72.0 removed the full sweep from every turn-in, correctly, and justified
  it with a login hook that did not exist â€” so rows dead for any reason other
  than a turn-in sat in the store, and every read filtered them at two client
  calls each. The login sweep exists now, and accepting a quest drops its pin.
- **The tooltip recovered the "over 20m" figure by stripping the word "over"
  off the front of its own sentence.** The number is passed now, and both
  surfaces phrase the fact the same way.
- **The first sight of a zone was reported as a change to it,** costing one
  needless ranking rebuild per zone per character.

## [0.72.0]

**The zone fix worked, and then cached its answer under the wrong key.**
0.71.0 matched the zone correctly and then remembered the match under
`GetBestMapForUnit` â€” the city map indoors, the same wrong value the release
was written to remove, moved from the match into the memory of it. This
release stops writing it down at all.

### Fixed â€” the journey, and the cost of keeping it current

- **The learned zone stamp never settled and was written to disk.** Walking
  into a building stamped one map, walking out stamped another, and the walk
  the stamp exists to avoid ran on every threshold crossed. It also let one
  zone hold two records with two maps, so the tab could show a different
  achievement on the two sides of a doorway â€” the hash-order symptom 0.71.0
  set out to end, reintroduced by the fix for it. The match is remembered in
  memory now, for the session, keyed on the zone name it was actually matched
  on, and the old field is removed from saved data.
- **What is remembered is the match, not the winner.** Which achievements are
  named after a zone depends only on their names and does not change while the
  game is running; which of them is the zone's own depends on whether you have
  earned it, and that can change at any moment. Earning a zone's story
  achievement now moves the tab onto its companion immediately instead of at
  the next login.
- **The zone list resolved a name and a category for every row in the store
  before throwing all but twelve away.** Two client calls per row, several
  hundred rows, from every refresh of the Journey tab. It sorts on the
  numbers, cuts, and names what is left.
- **A zone you had never set foot in could not be recommended** to the only
  player it matters to. Started and untouched zones were concatenated and cut
  from the end, so an account with fifty zones in progress lost every fresh
  one before the list was scored. A quarter of the room is held for them, and
  the zone you are standing in is always a candidate.
- **`/cn scanlore` reported a count for a scan that recorded nothing.** 0.71.0
  stopped such a scan marking itself as done and went on returning the number
  of rows it had walked past. It now says what happened.
- **A turn-in made about twelve hundred client calls to forget one pin.** The
  event hands over the quest id; the full sweep of the remembered-quest store
  ran anyway, on every turn-in, four times over at the end of a chain.
- **Toys and recipes looked up the same vendor twice per item.** 0.71.0
  collapsed the duplicated travel cost in both files and walked past the
  identical duplication one line above it.
- **The achievement criteria sweep dropped every update after the first in a
  burst** â€” including the one that crossed the boundary it was watching for â€”
  and never ran again until an unrelated update arrived. It now uses the same
  throttle its two siblings do, which answers at the start of a burst and
  again at the end.
- **Exploration rebuilt its recommendations on every criteria update**,
  whether or not a number had moved. Its sibling was given that test last
  release; the file it was copied from was not.

### Fixed â€” what the numbers say

- **The tooltip and `/cn list` gave different distances for the same
  objective.** The list stopped measuring past twenty minutes and printed
  nothing; the tooltip measured anyway and printed "About 47 minutes away".
  One function decides now â€” and instead of going silent for the farthest
  objectives, which reads as "unknown" rather than "very far", it says the
  journey is over twenty minutes.
- **The planner could never learn how long an instance, a vault run or a
  waiting objective takes.** Those rows carry a small hand-picked travel cost
  and no coordinates; 0.71.0 began rejecting every completion of them as
  unmeasurable, so `/cn plan` reported "not measured" for them permanently. A
  row with no place in it has no journey to subtract.
- **Every reputation scan undid a migration.** The addon has stripped the
  stored, localized standing from renown factions since 0.66.0, and the
  scanner wrote it straight back on the next `/cn repscan` â€” for every kind of
  faction â€” while the reader preferred the stored copy to deriving one. An
  alt's standing showed in whatever language and at whatever rank that
  character last scanned. Nothing localized is stored now; the one genuine
  exception, a friendship's free-text rank, is kept under its own name.
- **A zone already finished drew as unfinished on the Journey tab** â€” gold,
  full bar, "60 / 60" â€” on the row a player looks at most.

## [0.71.0]

**The quest-turn-in fix has been claimed three times and did not work any of
them.** 0.69.0 listened for the wrong event. 0.70.0 fixed the event and
introduced a zone lookup that was inert two separate ways. This release
replaces the invention with the solution the neighbouring module has used
since 0.62.0.

### Fixed â€” the journey, for real this time

- **In a city, the addon could not tell which zone you were in.** The lookup
  asked the game for your map, which answers with *Dornogal* when you are
  standing in Dornogal â€” and no achievement is named after a capital. So the
  refresh did nothing for any quest handed in indoors, which is where campaign
  turn-ins happen. It reads the surrounding zone now.
- **Everywhere else it refused on purpose.** It declined whenever two
  achievements contained the zone name, to avoid confusing the two Nagrands â€”
  and every modern zone ships a story achievement *and* a "Sojourner of
  <Zone>" companion, so it declined in all of them. The name is matched as a
  whole word at the end now, the true duplicates are settled by learning the
  map, and that learning also makes the refresh an integer comparison instead
  of a walk with a client call per row on the game's busiest questing event.
- **The tab and the refresh were using different lookups**, so the tab picked
  a zone happily while the refresh picked nothing, and the number on screen
  was one nothing could move. One lookup now.
- **Which of a zone's two achievements it showed depended on hash order.** A
  zone's story achievement and its "Sojourner of <Zone>" companion are both
  legitimate matches; the choice between them is now a named, total rule â€”
  unfinished first, then the shorter name, then the lower ID â€” so the tab
  shows the same one on every login rather than whichever the table happened
  to reach first.
- **An achievement the game will not answer about was recorded as not
  earned** â€” and the guard written to prevent that could not fire, because the
  game returns nothing rather than failing. One `CRITERIA_UPDATE` in the
  seconds after a loading screen un-earned a zone the account had finished.
- **A scan that measured nothing recorded itself as having run.** The criteria
  API routinely answers nothing at login, which is why the writer guards
  against it â€” and the marker saying "this character has scanned" was written
  anyway. An alt's first login after upgrading recorded nothing, marked itself
  done, and never rescanned: "not started" for every zone it had fully
  quested, permanently.
- **`/cn zones` and the Journey tab put zones with nothing left in them at the
  top**, with the reason "100% done â€” finishing is cheaper than starting". The
  recommendation list has always had that rule; the two display paths did not.

### Fixed â€” distances

- **One definition of a measured journey, instead of two.** The window's
  tooltips asked the travel model whether it was confident and printed nothing
  when it was not; `/cn list` and the deadline guard accepted any number that
  came back â€” including a multi-hop route through a flight network the model
  is partly guessing at. The same rare could show a distance in one and not
  the other.
- **A row could keep a stale answer about its own journey for ever.** When the
  addon reuses an unchanged candidate it compares a list of fields, and the
  new "was this journey measured" flag was not on it. Because the capped and
  fabricated costs are both exactly the same number, a row that gained a real
  measurement kept the old answer â€” and lost its deadline guard permanently.
- **Two providers priced every journey twice**, and the travel model
  deliberately does not cache a failure, so for any vendor it could not route
  that was two full estimates per row in the two highest-volume providers.

### Fixed â€” other

- **The addon could not find a faction by the name it had just printed.**
  Reputation names came off disk in whatever language last scanned, while the
  lookup asked the game â€” so a list row read one thing and searching for it
  found nothing. Five readers now ask the game first.
- **A provider registered after login never taught the window to redraw for
  its events.** The same closed-registry defect a previous release documented
  fixing, in the second of the two passes that has it.

## [0.70.0]

Eleven defects, and the honest headline is that **last release's fix for the
reported quest-turn-in problem did not work.** Most of what follows is the
rest of that mistake and its neighbours.

### Fixed â€” the quest turn-in, properly this time

- **0.69.0 wired the zone refresh to the wrong event.** `QUEST_TURNED_IN`
  fires *before* the game moves the achievement criteria, and the throttle
  around it runs on the first call â€” so for the ordinary case, one quest
  handed in, it read the number it already had and wrote it straight back.
  The reported symptom was unchanged. It listens for the criteria actually
  moving now, which is what the sibling module has always done.
- **And it told nothing.** The store changed and no part of the ranking was
  marked stale, so the recommendation kept its old "8 of 12 left in this
  zone".
- **It also cleared an achievement the account had already earned.** The flag
  was being derived by comparing two numbers that belong to *you*, while the
  flag itself belongs to the *account* â€” so an alt three quests into a zone
  the main had finished un-earned it in passing, and the addon started
  recommending a completed zone. It asks the game directly now.
- **And it could rewrite the wrong continent's zone.** Zone names repeat â€”
  two Nagrands, two Shadowmoon Valleys, three Dalarans â€” and the lookup
  matches on name. Where the name is ambiguous it now declines rather than
  guessing; the next login corrects everything anyway.

### Fixed â€” distances that were never measured

- **"About 20 minutes away" for something you can see from where you are
  standing.** The travel model never refuses: when it cannot work a journey
  out it hands back a placeholder, and every caller but one was throwing away
  the flag that says which is which. Four more places price content that is
  not anywhere at all â€” the Great Vault, a dungeon, a crafting order â€” with a
  small routing weight, and `/cn list` printed those as distances too.
- **The 0.69.0 deadline rule inverted itself at the top of its range.** Travel
  cost is capped, so every genuine journey over twenty minutes lands on the
  cap and became indistinguishable from "could not route this" â€” which was
  exempted. The result: of two world quests eight minutes from expiring, the
  *farther* one kept full urgency and the nearer one lost all of it.
- **A journey nobody measured was being subtracted from your measured task
  times**, biasing everything the addon has learned about how long things take
  you downward.

### Fixed â€” the rest

- **A scan at a cold moment could empty the whole Journey tab.** When the game
  declines to answer about criteria it answers zero, and the full scan wrote
  that in â€” while its own sibling forty lines below, and two other modules,
  all guard against exactly that.
- **A full walk of every quest achievement in the game, on every login, of
  every character, for ever.** The 0.69.0 rescan condition asked a question
  that can never become false. It records that a character has scanned
  instead.
- **`/cn rep <name>` could not find a faction after a client language
  change** â€” the third command of that shape, where the other two were
  converted two releases ago.
- **`/cn find` wrote quest pins to disk.** Building every tab so the search
  has something to read reached a function that records what it walks past.

## [0.69.0]

Fifteen defects, and an answer to two of the three things that have been
waiting on somebody logging in.

### Fixed â€” the ranking

- **The 0.68.0 urgency guard was wrong in the ordinary case.** It refused
  urgency to anything whose deadline was shorter than the journey *plus the
  median time this account takes over that whole type of thing* â€” so a "kill 8
  boars" world quest thirty yards away with five minutes left scored no
  urgency at all, because four campaign quests had set the median at eight
  minutes. World quests carry no other deadline signal, so that removed all of
  it. It also trusted a travel cost the addon uses to mean "far away, I
  stopped counting" â€” twenty minutes of journey that was never measured, which
  the client produces routinely for a window after every loading screen. The
  guard now fires only on a journey the model actually costed.
- **A deadline that counts for nothing now says so where you would look.**
  The explanation was added to a screen with one caller, `/cn order`. It is in
  the reasons list now, which is what `/cn why`, the row tooltip and the
  heads-up line all read.
- **`/cn alts` and `/cn selftest` were teaching the addon that twenty
  objectives had been shown to you** every time you ran them.

### Fixed â€” a quest you turn in

- **Handing in a quest did not move the Journey tab.** Zone progress was
  written by a full scan and by nothing else, and that scan runs at login, on
  `/cn scanlore`, and from the "Rescan zones" button â€” so the zone you had
  just advanced went on reporting the count it had when you logged in. This is
  the reported symptom, and it was never the recommendation list, which has
  always updated on turn-in. The zone you are standing in refreshes now, from
  two client calls, debounced so a chain handing in three at once costs one
  refresh.

### Fixed â€” alts

- **An alt could be permanently locked out of the 0.68.0 repair.** The rescan
  that fixed the Loremaster store triggered on a flag that is shared by the
  whole account, so the first character to log in fixed it for everybody and
  every other character then had no trigger left â€” while the thing *they* were
  missing was their own per-zone progress. And the migration that forced that
  repair emptied the store outright, which threw away every alt's progress to
  restore one boolean. It takes nothing now, and each character repairs itself
  the first time it plays.

### Fixed â€” numbers and text

- **`/cn list` printed the addon's internal "somewhere unknown" constant as a
  distance** â€” "20m away" for something you can see from where you are
  standing. It was the one day-one command the 0.68.0 fix did not reach.
- **`/cn goal` on a rare said "Seen 1 time here"** for a rare with no stored
  count, and the tooltip said "First time you have met it" again on the very
  next encounter after an upgrade.
- **The cross-tab search named tabs in English** â€” "Also on: Collections (12)"
  beside a tab strip reading *Sammlungen*.
- **The search hint could be drawn outside the window**, over the game, when
  four tabs matched at larger text sizes.
- **A type filter claimed rows the list does not contain** â€” it counted twelve
  while the list draws eleven, the twelfth being the headline above it.
- **The Welcome screen and the Hud options panel ignored the text-size
  setting**, which the release that introduced it named as fixed.
- **A store with a reader and no writer** was being recreated empty and
  written to disk at every logout, for ever, to answer nothing.

### Verified rather than fixed

- **The heads-up line can be dragged and closed**, and now the test suite says
  so. Both were built releases ago and neither had ever been checked by
  anything but a person â€” so "does it drag" was a question only playing could
  answer. It is movable, dragged from anywhere on it, clamped to the screen,
  its position is remembered across sessions, and the **x** in its corner
  turns it off rather than hiding it until the next login.

### Internal

- **A build lint was reading comments.** The check that every provider
  declares the events it depends on searched the whole file for a function
  name â€” so a comment *explaining* why something no longer calls that function
  reported it as calling it. It reads code now, which is the same correction
  the CI preflight made for the same reason.

## [0.68.0]

Fourteen defects. Eleven of them were in what 0.67.0 itself added, including
two that were quietly teaching the addon the wrong things about how you play.

### Fixed â€” the addon learning from things you never saw

- **Hovering the type filters told the addon it had shown you sixty
  objectives.** Asking for the ranking is how the addon records what it
  offered you â€” that count is the denominator of the ratio that moves a
  type's score by up to a quarter, and the top rows get a work clock started
  on them. A tooltip added last release asked for sixty rows on every hover
  while the list behind it draws twelve. Mousing down the checkbox list
  recorded rows you have never seen as shown, and started timing them.
- **`/cn find` did the same thing with the window closed** â€” twelve
  objectives marked as offered and clocked, as a side effect of typing a
  search.
- **A deadline you cannot possibly meet was scored as the most urgent thing in
  the game.** A world quest with eight minutes left, twelve minutes of flying
  away, sat at the top of the list. The addon holds both halves of that
  arithmetic â€” the journey, and how long this kind of work takes *you*,
  measured â€” and was using neither. `/cn why` now says "deadline (too soon to
  reach)" rather than dropping the term silently.

### Fixed â€” wrong numbers on screen

- **Every completed Loremaster achievement came back as unfinished.** A
  migration last release deleted a flag that is account-wide by design and
  that nothing rewrites, so `/cn zones` put "Loremaster of Khaz Algar 120/120"
  at the top of "worth doing next" with the reason "100% done â€” finishing is
  cheaper than starting". Repaired on upgrade, and the store now rebuilds
  itself when it is missing something rather than only when it is empty.
- **Two tooltips reported distances at double the addon's own estimate**, and
  printed "About 40 minutes away" for a rare thirty yards off whenever the
  client had not yet answered about your position â€” the internal
  "somewhere unknown" constant, rendered as a measurement. A journey the addon
  cannot estimate is now not described at all.
- **"Gone in 42m left whether you do it or not."** A value-column string
  interpolated into a sentence, which also opened a colour code mid-sentence
  when the game would not say how long was left.
- **A rare you have farmed for a year said "First time you have met it."**
  The upgrade that dropped inflated sighting counts turned a missing number
  into a confident wrong claim.
- **Quests in a neighbouring zone could be silently dropped.** The zone was
  priced from whichever remembered quest had the lowest id, and if that one
  had no stored coordinates the whole zone was treated as unreachable â€” up to
  twenty available quests one flight point away, invisible.

### Fixed â€” the interface

- **The currency sweep still never resumed after you closed the Currency
  tab.** Last release hooked that window's close, on an event the addon
  discards for every addon but itself â€” so the handler could only fire at the
  one moment the window is guaranteed not to exist. It was written,
  commented, and inert.
- **The eleven tab captions, the Welcome screen and the Hud panel ignored the
  text-size setting**, which the change that introduced it named as the thing
  it was fixing.
- **A checkbox's clickable area was measured once.** At 150% text the label is
  half again as wide as the button behind it, so the last third of the words
  showed no tooltip and did not toggle the box.
- **The "Also on:" search hint was drawn underneath the tab strip** in the
  muted, disabled face this addon reserves for text that carries no
  information. It sits beside the filter box now, in the accent colour.

### Internal

- **`CN.Recommend` can be asked quietly.** One ranking path, one place that
  decides whether an ask counts as an offer â€” rather than a second function
  that would drift from the first.
- **The cache-mutation counter is reported by `/cn errors`** instead of being
  written and read by nothing, and its guard now documents what it does and
  does not cover: it catches a list being appended to, which is the shape this
  has taken both times, and not a key added to a table.

## [0.67.2]

Still nothing in the addon. Two releases in a row were diagnosed as build
failures when the second one had not been built at all â€” `ci -Watch` was
reporting an older run, in failure red, with nothing saying it was not the
release just asked for.

### Fixed

- **`ci -Watch` now says when the run it is watching is not your version.**
  `release X` followed by `ci -Watch` reads as one flow and is not: the watch
  reports the newest run on GitHub, whatever that happens to be. When that
  does not match the version in the working tree it says so, in as many words,
  before anything else.
- **It prints the log URL when a run fails**, rather than directing you to a
  second command â€” which 0.67.0 proved could come back with nothing.
- **`release` checks that GitHub actually started a run.** A push can succeed
  and nothing happen: Actions disabled, the workflow missing from the default
  branch, a trigger that no longer matches. The command reported a healthy
  push either way, and the failure then looked like a broken build instead of
  a build that never began.

## [0.67.1]

0.67.0 built correctly and its release run failed, and the command whose whole
job is to say why printed one line and stopped. Nothing in the addon changed
here; this is the release pipeline and the tools around it.

### Fixed

- **`/cn ci` could report a failed run and name nothing.** Every useful line it
  prints â€” the step list, "FAILED AT", the link to the log â€” was inside a loop
  over a step list that came back empty, so a failed run produced a job name,
  a blank line, and the API budget. The log URL is printed first now,
  unconditionally, before anything that depends on the shape of the response;
  an empty step list is reported as the finding it is and re-asked for once;
  and a job that failed with no step marked failed says so and names the
  likeliest cause.
- **The release job was capped below the steps inside it** â€” 20 minutes around
  step budgets adding to 57. A cap like that is the real limit and the ones
  inside it are decoration: whichever step is running when the job clock
  expires is killed, nothing is marked failed, and the run reports a failure
  with nothing to point at. The job is bounded at 30 now, and the release
  rehearsal fails if a job is ever capped below the sum of its own steps
  again.
- **Mutation testing had been silently timing out on the runner.** The suite is
  314 mutations and each runs the whole test harness; that is 71% of its
  eight-minute budget on a fast machine, and the runner has two cores. Because
  the step is deliberately non-blocking, nothing failed and nothing said so â€”
  the release went green with its strongest suite not run. Budgeted at fifteen.

### Internal

- **The release rehearsal now enforces the runner's own limits.** It read the
  commands in each workflow step and nothing else, so the two constraints the
  runner applies around them were invisible: a step is now run under its real
  `timeout-minutes` and killed the way the runner would kill it, a step marked
  `continue-on-error` fails the way the runner treats it rather than stopping
  everything, and any step that passes using more than two thirds of its
  budget is called out â€” because this machine is faster than the runner, so
  "only just fits here" means "does not fit there".

  This is the same hole as the one that ended 0.61.0: the rehearsal passed
  locally because the local machine had something the runner did not. That
  time it was a missing binary and the answer was a preflight. This time it
  was a clock.

## [0.67.0]

Thirteen defects and four improvements. Eight of the thirteen were in what
0.66.0 itself added â€” including one that made a tab grow by five rows every
two seconds, and one that switched off the currency sweep for the session the
first time you opened your Currency tab.

### Fixed â€” 0.66.0's own additions

- **The Scans tab duplicated itself every two seconds.** The live rows were
  being appended onto the cached table rather than onto a copy of it, so
  standing with the window open, "Quests in your log" appeared fifteen times
  after half a minute and several hundred times after a few. The cache now
  notices when something has modified what it handed out, rebuilds, and
  reports it to `/cn errors`.
- **`/cn find` answered "nothing matches" if you had not opened the window.**
  It asked for the window rather than building one. It also only searched tabs
  you had clicked at least once â€” panels are created on first visit â€” so the
  search was blind to exactly the tabs you were least likely to have seen.
- **Text size could be raised and never lowered.** `/cn textsize 100` reported
  success and changed nothing; every label kept whatever larger font it was
  last given until you reloaded. The Settings button cycles back round to
  100%, which is the normal way to meet this.
- **Text size did not reach the arrow, the heads-up line, the follow frame or
  the map pin numbers** â€” the four widgets the setting exists for â€” nor any
  button or checkbox label in the window.
- **Opening your Currency tab once switched off the currency sweep for the
  rest of the session.** The check asked whether that panel's own flag was
  set, and a panel inside a closed window still answers yes. So `/cn
  currencies` served a store frozen at login, and a currency you capped that
  evening was never reported. The hook meant to catch you closing the window
  had also attached itself to your character sheet, because the currency panel
  does not exist yet when the addon loads.
- **An alt was offered no quests at all from the zones next door** if their
  main had cleared them: the new off-map list was filtered by what the
  *account* had finished rather than what *this character* had. And a quest
  giver twenty yards away could be offered as a journey to another zone,
  because standing in a city means the client names the city, not the zone
  around it.
- **Walking through new content re-costed every remembered zone every two
  seconds** â€” the cache key was a count of a six-hundred-row store, and that
  count moves continuously while you discover quests. It is a counter now, and
  it includes roughly where you are standing, so the cheapest-zones ordering
  is re-taken as you cross a zone instead of being fixed where you landed.
- **A hidden recipe showed the name of an unrelated item.** Recipes arrive
  from three different sources with three different kinds of id, and the
  client's item lookup was being asked first for all of them.

### Fixed â€” older

- **A new character read the main's Loremaster progress as its own** â€” "90 /
  120" with three done â€” permanently, because nothing rewrote the shared
  figure any more. The stale figures are cleared on upgrade, and Loremaster
  has been added to first-time setup, which it was missing from.
- **An achievement at 38 of 40 could vanish from the list.** When the game
  declines to answer about criteria â€” during a loading screen, or before the
  achievement UI has loaded â€” it answers zero, and that was written into the
  store as real progress. The neighbouring module has guarded this for
  several releases.
- **Typing in the filter box wiped whatever a button had just told you.** The
  cross-tab hint has its own line now.
- **`/cn hidden` could show `RECIPE claim`** â€” the addon's internals offered
  as the name of the thing you hid.

### New

- **`/cn provenance`** lists every prerequisite the addon believes on evidence
  rather than on somebody having read it â€” harvested from your own play,
  contributed by other players, or imported by hand â€” with how many characters
  or contributions stand behind each. `/cn why` has always said which source
  an answer came from; this is the opposite question, and it is where checking
  them starts.
- **Tooltips say why a row matters**, not only what it is. A world quest says
  when it disappears whether you do it or not, and roughly how far away it is.
  A rare says whether this character has already cleared it and how many times
  you have met it. A type filter says how much of the current list it is
  holding, which is the only thing that makes switching it off a decision.

### Internal

- **Every tooltip on every tab is now built during the test run** and must
  produce text with no `nil` in it. Tooltips are built on hover, so nothing in
  the suite had ever run one â€” and the first draft of the work above read a
  field the world-quest row does not carry.
- **A recording that does not cover a stub rule is a failure, not a note**,
  under `CN_REQUIRE_FULL_FIXTURES`. It is deliberately a separate switch: the
  recording in the repository is old enough to cover none of the three
  strongest rules, so arming it needs one fresh `/cn capture` first.
- **The test harness can measure what size a piece of text is drawn at.** It
  could not, which is why the four widgets drawn over the world were the only
  text in the addon no test could see.

## [0.66.0]

Nineteen defects and four features. The worst of the defects had made the
contribution workflow produce a file that would not load; the largest of the
features had been sitting on disk, collected and pruned, with nothing reading
it.

### Fixed â€” things that were plainly broken

- **`/cn export` produced Lua that did not parse.** A sweep that replaced a
  punctuation idiom across the addon reached inside three quoted strings that
  were deliberately writing a Lua comment into generated output, so every
  located quest carried a corrupt line. Anyone who pasted an export into their
  data file had an addon that would not load. The test now *loads* the export
  rather than looking at it.
- **`/cn title <name>` raised an error** for any title the current character
  did not already hold â€” which is the question the command exists to answer.
  Titles are resolved against the game's whole list now.
- **Every alt's Renown standing read `(nil)`** in `/cn rep`, `/cn who rep` and
  `/cn alts`. The stored English standing was correctly dropped last release
  and four places went on printing the field it had been dropped from.
- **`/cn goal` reported a rare you had met twice as "Seen 1,847 times here"**,
  and the number grew while you read it. It was counting event dispatches. A
  sighting is an encounter now, and the old inflated counts are discarded on
  upgrade rather than scaled, because there is no ratio to scale them by.
- **A character-specific faction's goal never said it was
  character-specific.** The check read a store that by construction holds only
  account-wide factions, so the sentence about progress not carrying across
  your Warband could not appear for the factions it is entirely about.
- **`/cn raredb` counted rares as cleared after they had expired** â€” while
  `/cn rares` was correctly offering the same ones again.
- **`/cn sells <name>` answered with the item's number**, having just looked
  that number up from the name you typed.
- **A new alt was shown the main's exploration and Loremaster progress as its
  own.** The per-character split added two releases ago was bypassed by a flat
  field that any character rewrote merely by flying through a zone.
- **The Scans tab froze** â€” "Quest givers on this map", whose own description
  reads "changes as you move", kept showing the count from wherever the window
  was opened, for the rest of the session.
- **The mount journal printed Alliance and Horde untranslated**, beside text
  that was correctly in your language.
- **Hidden rares were listed as `RARE 5487`** â€” the addon's own internals
  offered as the name of the thing you hid â€” and hidden recipes showed a
  number, or the previous language's name after a client language change.
- **The first currency you picked up after logging in ran the full sweep a
  second time**, seconds after the login sweep, because entering the world
  threw away the timestamp the login scan had just written.

### New

- **Quests in the zones next door.** The addon has been recording where every
  quest-start pin you ride past lives, and pruning that list, for many
  releases â€” and nothing ever offered you one. So it could see a quest twenty
  yards away and not one over the border, and would send you across the
  continent for a rare instead. The nearest three zones now contribute, priced
  by where the zone is rather than by each pin, and the reason names the zone.
- **Text size, separately from window size.** `/cn scale` grows the whole
  frame; `/cn textsize` and its Settings button grow only the letters. It uses
  your own client's font at a larger size, and it applies to text the window
  has already drawn rather than only to whatever it builds next.
- **`/cn find` searches every tab at once** and tells you which one the match
  is on. The filter box now also reports matches on the tabs you are not
  looking at, instead of saying "Nothing matched" while the answer sits one
  tab over.
- **The rare-vignette handler runs once a second instead of several times a
  second**, and reads the map once per run instead of twice. It was the
  addon's busiest event handler and it was writing to your saved variables
  every time.

### Internal

- **One way to strip colour codes from text.** It was written by hand in two
  files that had already drifted â€” one stripped inline textures and the other
  did not â€” so the sort key and the mount source line disagreed about what a
  string says.
- **The currency sweep it defers is now actually collected.** The code said it
  would happen "as soon as the player closes the window"; nothing made that
  true, and it waited for the next coin you picked up.
- **The test harness records what font a piece of text is drawn in.** It
  swallowed that, so the window's typography was invisible to every test â€”
  the seventeenth entry in this project's list of defects that a test stub
  simpler than the game made impossible to see.

## [0.65.0]

Nineteen defects. Fifteen of them were the *reading* half of a change made in
0.63.0 or 0.64.0: a name the addon correctly stopped storing, still being
displayed from the store that no longer had it. That produced blank text on
screen â€” a list entry reading "1. 1275" instead of "Explore Eversong Woods".
Two mechanical checks were added so this shape is caught by the build rather
than by a reader.

### Fixed â€” text you read

- **Zone exploration objectives had no name at all.** The recommendation list
  showed the achievement's number where its name belongs, on every client and
  in every language. So did the goal line, and so did "This zone" in `/cn
  exploration`.
- **A toy you have hidden could not be named**, and a mount goal stopped saying
  where the mount comes from â€” the sentence that makes the row actionable.
- **A rare's goal line printed a raw map number** instead of the zone's name.
- **Three vendor rows lost the zone they are in**, so "where do I buy this"
  answered with coordinates and no place.
- **`/cn title <name>` raised a Lua error** rather than printing the title, and
  a title you already hold reported itself with no name beside it.
- **`/cn titles` and the Titles breakdown told you to run a scan you had just
  run** â€” permanently. Both branch on how many titles exist, which had become
  zero for everyone.
- **Renown was written in English beside standings written in yours**, and was
  stored that way, so an alt's row stayed frozen at whatever language that
  character last logged in with.
- **"Account-wide" was doing two jobs at once**: the words shown to you *and*
  the value six guards compare against. Translating it would have flipped every
  one of those guards false and started recommending that you log out and
  switch characters for progress that is shared. It is a token now, and the
  sentence beside it is translated in all eleven locales.

### Fixed â€” behaviour

- **The currency throttle was inverted.** 0.64.0 cleared the timer *before*
  scanning rather than after, which guaranteed the second full sweep it was
  written to prevent: pick up one coin a second later and the entire three-pass
  read ran again.
- **Hidden mounts were named from disk first** and from the game second, alone
  among the collections.

### Faster

- **The Sources tab is cached like its two siblings.** It walked ten stores on
  every refresh â€” twice a second while the window is open.
- **A quest pin you have already seen no longer rewalks the remembered
  store.**

### Internal

- **Two build-time checks, because the process rule was not enough.** The rule
  after 0.63.0 was "when you change a writer, find every reader". It was
  followed, and it still missed fifteen readers across two releases. So: every
  candidate the addon can produce is now built at test time and asserted to
  have a real name, and any file that reads a saved-variable store the upgrade
  ladder deletes now fails the build. The second one matters more than it
  looks: asking for a store *creates* it, so a deleted store and a leftover
  reader do not cancel out â€” the reader silently puts it back, empty, at every
  login.
- **The last of the hand-rolled pluralizers, and the last two name stores.**
  Eight and ninth applications of one rule: persist only what the game cannot
  hand back for free.

## [0.64.0]

Twelve defects, found by looking for one specific thing: places where an
earlier fix landed at one call site and its siblings were missed. That search
was added to the process last release, and it found most of this one.

### Fixed â€” your progress, and whose it is

- **Zone exploration progress was shared between your characters.** How much
  of a zone you have explored was stored against the zone rather than against
  you, and the refresh runs when you *enter* a zone â€” so an alt flying through
  overwrote your main's progress in passing, with no scan involved. This is the
  same defect fixed for Loremaster three releases ago, in the neighbouring
  store the fix never reached.
- **The whole Exploration feature disappeared if you changed client
  language** â€” and so did the Loremaster zone lookup. Both matched an
  achievement name stored in the old language against a zone name in the new
  one. 0.62.0 fixed one half of that comparison and left the other frozen.
- **`/cn hidden` mixed languages in one list.** Faction, title and currency
  names came off disk while pet and mount names beside them came from the
  client.
- **The heads-up line said "nothing actionable" in English** while the data
  broker feed an inch away said it in yours. Same sentence, one of the two
  hardcoded.
- **Alliance and Horde were printed untranslated** on the Warband roster,
  beside a class name that had been translated correctly.
- **`/cn clock` reported currencies the game has retired**, which `/cn
  currencies` had already correctly dropped, on the same login. One staleness
  rule; two of the three readers applied it.
- **`/cn breakdown` subtracted one population from another** â€” it counted
  every currency row it had ever seen and then subtracted only the live ones.

### Faster

- **Seven milliseconds every two seconds, while questing.** Reputation ticks
  and quest turn-ins were moving the counter that the Collections tab, the
  Warband roster and the whole Remaining report use to decide whether anything
  has changed. Since a reputation tick fires many times a second, every one of
  those caches rebuilt on every window refresh â€” the caches were doing nothing
  in exactly the situation they were written for.
- **The currency sweep no longer runs every ten seconds** â€” nor while your own
  currency window is open. It briefly expands and re-collapses your currency
  headers to see rows the game hides, and a player with that window open
  watched their groups pop open and shut all evening. It waits until you close
  it.
- **A per-category snapshot of achievement totals stopped being written to
  disk.** It was rewritten at every logout, re-parsed at every login, and read
  by nothing at all.

### Internal

- **Why a quest is blocked is a token now, not a sentence.** The reason was
  recovered by pattern-matching English display text that had already been
  half-translated â€” one more translation away from telling you the wrong alt
  could do a quest.
- **One pluralizer.** The shared one had a single caller while twenty-two
  places wrote the same expression by hand and one module kept a third private
  copy. Nothing was wrong yet; it is the one-fix-one-call-site shape waiting to
  happen.

## [0.63.0]

Fourteen defects. Half of them were places an earlier release fixed one caller
and left the others â€” so this one ends with a rule about that, and a backlog
rewritten to match what is actually still open.

### Fixed â€” numbers and text the player reads

- **A capped currency printed the two numbers its cap was *not* measured
  against.** 0.62.0 taught the addon that some caps apply to what you have
  earned rather than what you hold, and then went on displaying the balance:
  "At cap â€” spend these: 100 / 2500". The row now shows what the cap was
  measured against, says so, and carries the balance beside it.
- **A currency you can *move* between characters was treated as one every
  character shares.** So a balance belonging to exactly one character was
  labelled "(Warband)" and the advice about which character should spend it
  disappeared.
- **`/cn alts` printed `DEATHKNIGHT`** while `/cn warband`, listing the same
  characters in the same session, printed "Death Knight".
- **A quest name guessed from a map pin outranked the real one.** Every name
  read back as though the client had vouched for it, so the authoritative
  quest-log title that arrived later was rejected as no better, and `/cn cache`
  reported a guess as fact.
- **Weekly knowledge was still ordered by an English word.** 0.61.0 demoted
  that from deciding whether a row appears to deciding where it sorts, which is
  the same bug with a smaller blast radius. It is ordered by how much of the
  week's cap is unclaimed now â€” true in every language.
- **The Refresh button on the Remaining tab still could not recount your
  quests.** The parameter that makes it recount was added a release ago and
  given no caller.
- **"This session" was never the client's own count.** The figure meant to
  include quests completed by any means â€” including ones the addon saw no event
  for â€” could not be computed, because the baseline is taken at login and the
  client cannot answer that early. It is taken from the first real answer now.
- **An ordering the addon inferred from watching you play could never be
  corrected.** Written once and frozen, even after later play contradicted it â€”
  and that is the copy the curated data file is built from.
- **Vendor zone names, and mount and toy names, were frozen at whatever
  language last scanned.** Around 1,900 rows of localized text off disk; a
  player who switches client language can now find their own mounts by name
  again.

### Faster

- **Walking into new content no longer rewalks your quest history.** Quests are
  discovered dozens at a time on entering a new zone, and each batch put the
  30,000-entry walk back on the next turn-in. Both edges of that count are
  maintained one quest at a time now.
- **The arrow stopped allocating a table ten times a second** whenever your
  best map differs from your target's â€” a city, an inn, a cave, most of the
  time it is on screen.
- **Debug text is no longer built when debug is off.** It was assembled on
  every cache invalidation, which happens tens of times a second while questing,
  and then discarded unread.

### Changed

- **A deadline is charged once.** World quests and world events set two
  different urgency terms from the same expiry, scored through two curves tuned
  separately â€” and `/cn urgency`, which the addon offers as its explanation of
  the ordering, plots only one of them. Now there is one curve, and it is the
  one the chart shows.

## [0.62.0]

An audit release. Fifteen defects, several of which had been quietly wrong for
many versions â€” including two whole features that could never once have worked,
and three places where the addon decided something by reading an English word.

### Fixed â€” features that were silently dead

- **Exploration never found the zone you were standing in.** The lookup
  compared an achievement name â€” "Explore Eversong Woods" â€” against a zone
  name, "Eversong Woods", and those are never equal. So the exploration
  recommendations, the per-zone block in `/cn exploration`, and the learned map
  id that resolves the two Shadowmoon Valleys were all dead on every client
  since 0.59.0. The test suite could not see it because the fixture invented a
  matching row whenever the lookup failed.
- **Recipe items were recognised only in English.** "Recipe: Flask of Alchemy"
  is "Rezept: â€¦" on a German client, so the tooltip line that says whether you
  or one of your characters already knows a recipe never appeared for anyone
  not playing in English. The prefix is now found by structure rather than by
  the English word.
- **Mounts were ranked by an English sentence.** A vendor mount two zones away
  ranked the same as a one-percent raid drop on every non-English client. The
  game supplies a number for this, and the addon had been storing it, unused,
  the whole time.

### Fixed â€” numbers that were wrong

- **`/cn petscan` and `/cn pets` disagreed about the same journal.** The game
  lists a pet you own once per copy you hold, so every duplicate was counted as
  another species.
- **"This session" could report your entire questing career.** The client
  returns an empty list â€” not nothing â€” before it has finished loading your
  quests, and that empty list was taken as a real baseline of zero.
- **A currency capped on what you have *earned* said you were not capped once
  you spent the balance** â€” so the row that exists to warn you about wasted
  earning stayed silent about exactly that.
- **"Within two criteria of finishing" was counted three different ways**, one
  of which included achievements that were already finished.
- **The Remaining tab went stale after learning recipes or earning a title**,
  and after a scan. Two lists of "what changes a collection count" had drifted
  apart; there is one list now.
- **`/cn warband` printed `DEATHKNIGHT`** rather than the class name in your
  language.

### Faster

- **21 ms off every five seconds while questing.** Every criteria update swept
  every tracked achievement, and the client is asked once *per criterion* â€”
  several thousand calls, for rows whose movement changes nothing you can see.
  It now polls the handful near the boundary plus anything you have pinned.

### Smaller on disk, and fresher

- **Mount source text is no longer stored** â€” around nine hundred rows of
  localized prose the client returns instantly. A stale zone name on every rare
  went with it.
- **Mounts, pets and toys now refresh at login.** They relied entirely on
  "collected!" events, so anything collected in a session where the addon was
  not loaded was recommended to you until you rescanned by hand.

### Internal

- **Character keys are built by one function.** A second copy had the realm and
  name the wrong way round, which would have made every currency row on an alt
  read as another character's.

## [0.61.1]

A build fix. 0.61.0 was verified and never published: its release run stopped
at the performance-budget step with "command not found".

### Fixed

- **The release could not complete.** 0.61.0 moved the performance budgets
  onto Lua 5.1 â€” the interpreter the game actually runs, and about half the
  speed of the 5.4 they had always been measured on. The step called `lua5.1`
  without checking it was there. The build machine did not have it, so the
  step exited 127 and everything after it, including the upload, never ran.
  The step ten lines above it had always checked; this one was written without
  looking at it.
- **The step now checks for Lua 5.1 before using it**, the way the harness
  step beside it always has. It runs on 5.1 wherever 5.1 exists â€” including
  the local release rehearsal, where every budget in this release was measured
  â€” and says plainly when it had to fall back rather than failing the build.
  Installing 5.1 on the build machine was tried and rejected: this project
  does not take its toolchain from the runner's package manager, because a
  package lock once hung a release for no reason anybody could act on.
- **The release rehearsal now catches this whole class before a tag is
  pushed.** It runs the real workflow's steps locally, and it passed 0.61.0 â€”
  because this machine happens to have Lua 5.1 and the build machine does not.
  A local success is not evidence about the runner. Every tool the workflow
  invokes must now either be installed by the workflow itself or be checked
  for, and the rehearsal refuses to proceed otherwise.

No addon behaviour changed. Everything in 0.61.0 below ships unaltered.

## [0.61.0]

Numbers, and what they cost. Two themes ran through this release: figures that
were wrong in ways nobody could see from inside the addon, and work the addon
was doing repeatedly for answers that had not changed.

### Fixed â€” figures that were wrong

- **A percentage never reads as finished until it is.** Four places rounded,
  so 999 of 1,000 printed "100%" on a row that was still outstanding, and
  1 of 400 printed "0%" for real progress. The progress bar made the same
  claim: at twenty cells wide, anything from 39 of 40 up drew a full one. Both
  now clamp away from the ends, and every percentage in the addon goes through
  one place.
- **An achievement 9 of 31 done reported 9 of 25.** The criteria reader capped
  its own loop at twenty-five and handed back the number of rows it had
  collected as the total â€” so every meta achievement in the game, which is
  precisely what a chase list is for, was measured against a window instead of
  against itself. The list is still capped, and says how many rows it did not
  show; the count is the achievement's.
- **Paragon read "34500/10000".** The client's paragon value is cumulative
  across every cache already collected and never resets. It is now reported as
  the position inside the current cycle, with the number of caches already
  earned said plainly beside it.
- **Weekly profession knowledge found nothing on a non-English client.** It
  was gated on the English word "knowledge" appearing in the currency's
  localized name. The gate is now the fact the client vouches for in every
  locale â€” a weekly cap with room left under it.
- **A nearly-complete transmog set could vanish from the list.** Set ids and
  appearance category ids are both small integers from unrelated Blizzard
  tables, and both were filed under the same type, so the aggregate dedup
  silently dropped whichever arrived second. Ignoring one ignored the other,
  too.
- **A lockout answered for the wrong difficulty.** The client returns one row
  per difficulty and they all carry the same name; the match was on the name
  alone. With one difficulty still open, the answer to "can I go and kill it"
  is now yes.
- **Your daily count no longer resets when you zone.** One silent moment from
  the client â€” a loading screen â€” moved today's progress into yesterday and
  restarted today at one.
- **Loremaster progress is attributed to the character that earned it.** The
  store had no character dimension, in a store whose purpose is showing what
  other characters have finished, so whichever character scanned last
  overwrote everybody.
- **The same zone picks the same achievement every time.** The match is a
  substring and the tie-break was table order, so the Journey tab could show a
  different achievement for the same zone on different logins.
- **A map pin you dragged is yours again.** The guard that stops
  `/cn clearway` deleting a hand-placed pin compared only the map â€” and
  dragging a pin leaves it on the same map, so the one case the guard existed
  for was the one case it could not see.
- **Three self-tests could not fail.** The facing check reported "confirmed"
  during the exact window in which it had already seen evidence the arrow was
  backwards; two others counted something and then passed regardless.
- **A lockout with no reset time crashed `/cn drops`** rather than saying
  "unknown".

### Faster

- **15.3 ms off the login frame.** The data-broker feed rebuilt every
  candidate in the game from a login hook that runs before anything has been
  scanned â€” for a result it then almost always discarded.
- **13.7 ms off the Remaining tab.** It walked all thirty thousand discovered
  quests, asking the client about each, for a number that changes by one when
  you hand a quest in. It is counted once and maintained.
- **4.4 ms off every route.** The 2-opt pass ran twelve times; measured over
  three thousand routes, passes four through twelve changed nothing.
- **4.0 ms off the Zone tab, 4.4 ms off Scans, 2.3 ms off Warband.** All three
  rebuilt, every two seconds, answers that only change when you collect
  something.
- **1.4 MB a minute of garbage off the arrow.** It built a fresh state table
  ten times a second for as long as it was on screen.
- **2.3 MB of memory released when you leave a zone**, and 138 KB less
  allocated on every rebuild.
- **The performance gate now runs on the interpreter the game runs.** Every
  budget in this project was enforced under Lua 5.4, which is about twice as
  fast as the 5.1 the client uses â€” so a path at 60% of its ceiling was at
  120% of it in the game.

### Smaller on disk

- **The largest store in the addon lost its wrapper.** Quest names were kept
  as two-field tables, thirty thousand of which said only that the name came
  from the client. A row is the name itself now.
- **Achievement names stopped being written to your database.** Sorting the
  "closest to finishing" list wrote a name the client hands over for free onto
  the saved row, permanently, for every achievement it touched.

### Changed

- **Chat answers share one shape.** A headline, the rows, the value, a note
  when the list was cut short â€” written once instead of in every command.
- **"3 piece(s) left" is now "3 pieces left".** Counts read the way a person
  writes them, and a class restriction reads as "class only: Warrior and
  Paladin" rather than as the client's uppercase tokens.

### Internal

- **The build now fails if a local function is called above its own
  declaration.** In Lua that is a nil global and it throws only when the line
  runs, which is why it shipped twice.

## [0.60.0]

A player reported that a quest they had handed in stayed on the list. It did,
and the reason turned out to be a whole class of defect: something that can go
out of date, with nothing able to tell it. This release is that class, found
and closed â€” thirteen instances, plus the three things reported from play.

### Fixed â€” reported from play

- **A quest you handed in stayed on the list and on the route.** The provider
  that reports nearly-finished quest objectives â€” "Kill Ten Rats: 1 more" â€”
  reads the quest log and declared only bag events, and a provider that is not
  named by an event is not invalidated at all. So the row survived the turn-in
  until a bag update or a loading screen happened along. The build now fails
  if a provider reads a system whose events it does not declare.
- **The heads-up line could not be dragged.** It was the only frame in the
  addon at the lowest strata â€” the arrow and the follow frame, which sit over
  the world in exactly the same way, are both at the ordinary one â€” so
  anything else on screen took the mouse first and all three of the actions
  its own tooltip promised did nothing.
- **The heads-up line has a way out on itself.** An **x** in its corner, shown
  when the mouse is over the line, that turns it off rather than hiding it â€”
  hiding would bring it back on the next refresh. `/cn hud` brings it back.

### Fixed â€” the same class, found by audit

- **A goal you finished never left the list**, and follow mode stuck on it. A
  goal can be a quest, a mount, a pet, a toy, an achievement or a reputation,
  and the provider declared one event: the zone change. Since follow mode
  decides a stop is done by asking whether it is still on the list, this stuck
  the route on something already completed until you crossed a zone boundary.
- **"Invalidate everything" invalidated nothing.** Two events were on a list
  whose comment says they "must invalidate EVERYTHING regardless of who
  declared what". The list was only used to make sure those events were
  subscribed; the ordinary per-provider filter was then applied to them like
  any other. No provider declares `PLAYER_LEVEL_UP`, so levelling up reached
  none of them. Four call sites passing a word that is not an event name
  reached none of them either.
- **The window redrew for six events and missed everything else** â€” a second
  hand-written list, of the kind this project already records as fixed once.
  In a city, where none of the six fire, looting a toy left "collect this toy"
  on screen, and **dying did not show the corpse run**, which is the one thing
  the addon weights above everything else. The list now comes from what the
  providers themselves declare.
- **A deferral that ran out never brought the thing back.** Right-click the
  heads-up line to put a mount off for an hour, and an hour later it stayed
  gone, while `/cn hidden` reported the deferral as expired â€” the addon
  contradicting itself about its own state.
- **A currency retired at the end of a season was recommended for ever.** The
  store only ever grew, and nothing checked whether the client still lists a
  currency â€” so "at cap, further earning is wasted" kept appearing, with a
  fresh urgency bonus every weekly reset, for something that no longer exists.
- **A crafting order still said it expired in six hours, six hours later.**
  The one deadline-carrying provider that did not expire on its own.
- **The subzone count froze the moment you entered a zone.** The provider
  rebuilt on the event that fires when you discover one, and re-read the same
  stored figure each time. And a zone finished this session was never recorded
  as finished, so it sat at the top of "closest to done" reading nothing left.
- **A character you deleted a month ago went on reordering today's list.**
  Every recipe, reputation, title and profession that alt covered was ranked
  down on the character you are actually playing, with the deleted one named
  as the reason. The addon already has a staleness rule and states it plainly;
  the suggestions honoured it and the scoring did not.
- **A party member finishing a quest never stopped counting.** The answer
  comes from their quest log, the client fires no event about it, and the
  invalidation was subscribed to your own quest events â€” which never fire for
  anybody else.
- **A zone that refused flight before your Pathfinder unlock refused it for
  ever.** Every route to that zone was costed at ground speed, roughly three
  and a half times too slow, correctable only by flying back into the zone â€”
  the one thing the wrong estimate discourages.
- **A toy kept the travel cost it had in the zone you left**, because it was
  the only located provider that did not watch for a zone change.
- **Bumping the decorator counter reached nothing.** Three of its five callers
  moved a number that is only read while a provider is already being rebuilt â€”
  including the registry itself, whose own comment says a decorator
  registering late must reach the rows that already exist.
- **Appearances were the one scanned collection with no refresh at login**, so
  anything collected on another character, or in a session where the addon was
  not loaded, stayed uncounted until something transmoggable happened.

### Changed

- A tooltip no longer silently deletes a hover handler that was already there
  â€” a trap invisible at the call site and dependent on the order two unrelated
  lines happen to be written in.
- Two exploration achievements whose zones share a name â€” retail has two
  Nagrands and two Shadowmoon Valleys â€” no longer overwrite each other's
  progress. The record is keyed on the map now, which cannot be duplicated.
- A client that will not answer no longer overwrites what was scanned: a
  refusal reads as zero, and zero is not a measurement.
- The window's redraw and the ranking's rebuild are told apart. A reputation
  tick marks things stale; it does not force twenty-three providers to drop
  the cooldowns they declared. Pinning a goal still bypasses all of them,
  because you are waiting for it.

### Internal

- Two build-time checks added: a provider must declare the events of every
  system it reads, and no panel field may be cleared in a way a frame can
  answer over.
- The offline frame stub gained the ability to express a quest being handed
  in, a mount being collected, a client that will not say where you are, a
  frame's strata and movability, and where a region was actually anchored.
  Six more entries in the running list of defects hidden by a stub more
  forgiving than the client â€” including the one behind the report that opened
  this release.
- Thirty-one mutations added; two hundred and twenty-six now run and all are
  killed.
- An adversarial review of this release's own changes found eight more
  defects in them, two of which were performance regressions this release
  introduced: one path measured at three quarters of a frame, fired every five
  seconds while questing. Both are fixed and both have mutations.


## [0.59.0]

The largest accuracy pass since 0.54.0. Six things the addon was getting
quietly wrong, two of them in the ranking itself; a performance pass that
removes work the addon was doing on every reputation tick; and the chat and
window surfaces held to the rules the project already states about them.

### Fixed

- **Glancing at the next zone over took the batch bonus off the zone you were
  standing in.** Batching was written onto the objective tables themselves,
  which are shared, so the router had to clear it everywhere before stamping
  this map's â€” and the map pins re-route on every world-map pan. The bonus is
  worth up to three points, comparable to the entire range of an objective's
  own value, and the route cache meant it could not come back: re-routing your
  own zone returned a cached route whose hubs were still drawn as a group of
  four while nothing in the ranking knew about them. Batching now belongs to
  the router and describes exactly one map.
- **Rares and treasures were priced by a formula nothing else used.** Straight
  line, in map units, times ten â€” which asserts that a map unit is the same
  number of yards north-south as east-west (the defect behind the arrow bug of
  0.40.0, in a different file), that every zone is about 2,100 yards across,
  and that you are on foot. They go through the travel model now, like quests,
  vendors and everything else with a location. A rare the client will not place
  was also priced at zero, which the addon reads as "you are standing on it".
- **A quest with no location was cheaper than one you could see.** The quest
  provider carried its own price for "no idea where this is" â€” 5, against the
  8 the rest of the addon uses. And for a second or two after every loading
  screen, when the client will not say where you are, every located quest in
  your log was scored as though you were standing on top of it.
- **A world event's deadline could be half an hour stale.** The countdown was
  computed when the calendar was read and the list is held for thirty minutes,
  so the addon printed "ends in 40m" about an event that finished ten minutes
  ago â€” and the urgency weighting, whose steep ramp lives entirely inside the
  last two hours, was fed that figure exactly where it matters most.
- **A world event was filed under its translated name**, so ignoring one was
  lost the day you changed client language, and two events sharing a title on
  one day collapsed into a single row.
- **Pruning the harvest store left quests carrying an unlock bonus** derived
  from records that no longer existed â€” the second-heaviest term in the
  ranking, and a `/cn why` sentence describing rows that had been deleted.
- **`/cn plan 12.5` errored on one interpreter and lied on the other.** The
  same class of defect as the two-argument `math.atan` bug of 0.43.1, with the
  polarity reversed: the offline suite would have caught it if anything had
  ever passed a fraction.
- **The heads-up line named one thing and acted on another.** Its click and
  right-click read a value only the window, `/cn next` and the minimap ever
  set â€” so if you turned the line on and never opened the window, its tooltip
  promised two actions and both did nothing, silently.
- **Two Settings controls were drawn on top of two others**, including the
  text-size button sitting on the "announce rares" checkbox and taking its
  clicks. The same defect this file recorded as fixed for another pair four
  releases ago, reintroduced by inserting two controls above the anchor.
- **A search that matched nothing told you to run a scan.** On the Collections
  tab a typo produced "Nothing scanned yet. Press Scan everything." â€” which
  freezes the client for several seconds and leaves the list just as empty.
- **"Clear waypoints" said nothing and left the map pins.** The button
  discarded the answer to "did that work?", which the command form has always
  reported, and its tooltip named pins it never removed.
- **The Now tab said "daily in 4h left"**, on every visit, and "in unknown
  time left" when the client would not answer.

### Changed

- **Nothing is re-decorated on a reputation tick.** Two handlers bumped the
  one counter that defeats the addon's unchanged-provider shortcut, and
  `UPDATE_FACTION` fires many times a second while you are questing â€” so the
  shortcut was permanently off exactly when it was most needed. The first
  event of a burst is still answered immediately; the rest collapse into one.
- **Learning that is switched off now costs nothing.** The preference adjuster
  asked the client whether each quest belonged to a campaign before checking
  whether learning was enabled: measured at 130 protected calls per re-rank,
  repeated on every re-rank, whether or not the feature was on. The answer
  cannot change while the client is running, so it is worked out once per row.
- **The route optimiser is 14% faster** on a ninety-stop zone, and its pruning
  bound is now provably sound rather than empirically safe.
- **The hearthstone is costed, once you have used one.** The client reports a
  bind point as a localized inn name and the addon has no way to turn that into
  a map â€” so the one teleport every player owns was listed and never priced.
  It now notices where you land after a hearth and remembers it. Until that
  happens the row says so rather than staying silently uncosted.
- **The Scans tab says what its two odd rows mean.** Currencies and
  professions report a different shape from the other six and came out blank â€”
  on the tab whose header is "where every number comes from".
- **Every row that does something carries a marker**, not two steps of
  brightness â€” which is this addon's first rule, broken in the widget every
  tab is built out of, and defeated entirely wherever a tab colours its whole
  label.
- **The Next tab's three buttons go dead when they cannot act.** On a fresh
  install the first thing you see is "Nothing actionable yet" above three
  live-looking buttons, and in the type-filter mode they acted on something
  off screen.
- **A checkbox's label is part of its hit area.** Twelve settings carried
  their only explanation on a 24-pixel square, so hovering the words â€” the
  obvious target â€” showed nothing.
- **`/cn setup` says what each of its eleven numbers counted.** Three of them
  count something other than the label: "Appearances: 17" was slot categories,
  beside "Mounts: 1104". Its block also read bottom-up, with the headline
  after the detail.
- **Eighty-two answers stopped repeating the addon's name once per row**, and
  the build check that was meant to catch that now sees the spelling the
  codebase actually uses â€” it was matching `CN.Print(` while thirty files
  alias it. `/cn help flat` said "Completion Navigator:" a hundred and
  twenty-six times.
- **The em dash got its spaces back** at thirteen places where a mechanical
  replacement had removed them.
- **The Journey tab's progress bars are real bars**, not runs of `=` and `-`
  that got shorter as they filled, and its counts are in the value column with
  every other tab's.
- **Three tabs had an empty state that could never appear**, each shadowed by
  a differently-worded row; the Zone tab now says the client has not placed you
  yet rather than offering a button that cannot help.
- **Answering the welcome screen no longer closes it**, which used to take the
  scan button â€” the one thing on it that matters â€” with it.
- **The Warband column says "titles" rather than "tit"**, matching the two
  places on the same tab that spell it out.
- **A discovered quest is one fact rather than three fields**, none of which
  anything read, on a store that holds tens of thousands of rows on a mature
  account. Deliberately still uncapped: unlike the two stores beside it, the
  set IS the answer, and a ceiling would quietly make it a smaller one.

### Internal

- Three build-time checks added, each of which fails the build: no panel field
  may be cleared to `nil` (a frame can answer for an absent key, which this
  project has now shipped three defects of), no colour may be written as a
  raw float triple in a table constructor, and the loop check above.
- The offline frame stub now models an edit box losing focus, a font string
  reporting its width, a client that will not say where the player is, a
  calendar event with a real end time, and a hearthstone bind location. Five
  more entries in the running list of defects hidden by a stub more forgiving
  than the client â€” including the one that made the Next tab's main branch
  unreachable offline for eleven releases.
- Thirty-five mutations added; a hundred and ninety-five now run and all are
  killed. One was removed with a written argument for why it is not a defect.
- An adversarial review of this release's own changes found nine more defects
  in them, two of which were regressions this release introduced. Both are
  fixed and both have mutations.


## [0.58.0]

A pass over the window, because the ranking has been the focus for four
releases and the surface that shows it had drifted. Plus two accuracy fixes
that change what the addon recommends, and one that changes what it counts.

### Fixed

- **Every mount sitting in your bags was recommended as uncollected, for
  ever.** The check read `mount.collected`; the client's field is
  `isCollected`. It was always nil, so every bag item that teaches a mount --
  including ones learned years ago -- came back as something to go and do, and
  no scan could clear it.
- **A travel cost of zero was correct and a cost of zero was also "I have no
  idea".** Things with no location at all were priced at the cost of walking
  across a zone, so an item in your bags competed with a rare on the far side
  of the map. Placeless work now costs nothing to reach, which is the truth,
  and the type list that gets that treatment covers pets, mounts, toys,
  appearances and recipes.
- **Routing the same zone re-ranked the entire addon every two seconds.** The
  Zone tab, every map open and follow mode's ticker all call the router, and
  it ended by invalidating the ranked list unconditionally -- so the cache had
  a hit rate of zero for as long as any of those was open. It now re-ranks only
  when a route actually moves something. Measured: thirty Zone-tab ticks
  produced thirty full re-ranks and zero changes.
- **The route planner's pruning was not exact.** Three thousand random routes
  were laid out with and without it; two hundred and ninety came out longer
  with it on. A shortcut that produces a worse answer is not a shortcut.
- **`/cn dbsize` counted a bank's bookkeeping as items.** A Warband bank
  holding nothing was reported as three rows, and one holding four items as
  seven -- wrong by an amount that looks plausible.
- **A contribution another provider had stopped making could outlive it.** The
  merge reset ran on the row it was merging into and not on the row being
  merged, so a value withdrawn on one pass could survive to the next.
- **Two rows with no id crashed the ranked sort** on the comparison that broke
  the tie between them.

### Changed

- **The Scans tab is rebuilt as a provenance list.** It was one block of
  concatenated text, two buttons and no list -- nothing to click, nothing to
  sort, and its own filter box sat above it doing nothing. It now answers the
  question no other tab does: where does each number in this addon come from,
  how old is it, and what refreshes it. One row per source, live sources
  separated from stored ones, a marker on anything read more than a day ago,
  and a click runs that source's scan.
- **Sorting and filtering no longer shred rows that belong together.** A goal
  and its chain, a vault slot and its thresholds, a Remaining row and its
  reasons now move as one unit; a heading stays at the top of its own section
  while the rows under it still sort among themselves.
- **Sorting reads the words, not the markup in front of them.** The key was
  the rendered string, so "A to Z" sorted on colour codes and route numbers
  first: on the Goals tab every finished goal sorted above every unfinished
  one whatever they were called, and on the Zone tab clicking the header did
  nothing at all. The filter shared the key, so typing `cff` matched every row
  in the addon.
- **The Collections tab says when each number was read.** Every percentage on
  it is measured against the addon's own scan snapshot, which is the honest
  denominator and one that goes stale the day the game adds collectibles.
  Nothing on screen said when the snapshot was taken.
- **A button's answer appears in the window, not behind it.** Eleven buttons
  answered into the chat frame, which is somewhere else on the screen from
  where the click happened. Slash commands still answer in chat, because that
  is where those were typed.
- **The filter box goes dead on the two tabs it cannot reach**, instead of
  staying white and typeable while every keystroke did nothing.
- **A blocked step in a goal chain carries a marker as well as a colour.**
  Done was `x`, next was `>`, and blocked -- the one state that says stop
  reading down the chain -- had only red text.
- **Escape closes the welcome screen**, which was the only frame the addon
  puts on screen that it did not close, and the only one most players see.
- **Every panel edge is on the four-pixel grid.** Headers, lists, notes and
  the footer used four different left edges.
- **Every font is asked for by role.** Six widgets outside the window still
  named `GameFont*` objects directly and had drifted apart; two roles that did
  not exist are the reason, and now do.
- **An answer printed in a loop no longer repeats the addon's name once per
  row.** A thirty-row answer said "Completion Navigator:" thirty-one times.
- **A scan that fails gives its button back.** The Collections buttons
  disabled themselves, ran the scan and re-enabled afterwards -- so a scan
  that threw left the button reading "Working..." until the next reload.
- **Leaving a filtered tab clears that tab's filter**, rather than only the
  box above it; and visiting the one tab without a list no longer throws away
  the filter term you asked to keep.

### Internal

- Three build-time lints added, each of which fails the build: no colour may
  reach a frame as a raw float triple, no loop may call `CN.Print`, and the
  palette scan now covers both shapes of colour.
- The offline frame stub now fires `OnEditFocusLost` on `ClearFocus` and
  records edit-box text, which is the eleventh defect this project has traced
  to a stub more forgiving than the client.
- Eighteen mutations added; a hundred and fifty-nine now run and all are
  killed. Two existing assertions were rewritten because they checked a flag
  that existed only to be checked.


## [0.57.0]

The reason-tracking machinery is rebuilt rather than patched again, because
three consecutive releases each shipped a different symptom of the same cause.
Plus the largest performance pass since 0.54.0, and an accuracy fix that
changes what the addon recommends.

### Fixed

- **The shape that kept breaking is gone.** Every reason â€” the provider's own,
  a decorator's, another provider's, an adjuster's â€” was appended to one array
  on the objective, and each of four writers with four different lifetimes had
  to know where its own entries began and ended in order to take them back.
  That produced, in three consecutive releases: sentences repeated once per
  rebuild, sentences deleted and unrestorable, a quest collecting every state
  it had ever been in, and an unlock count frozen because a rollback nilled
  half its bookkeeping. Each was fixed; the shape that produced them was not.
  Nothing writes into anything it does not own now, so there is no boundary
  index to go stale, and the build fails on a write from outside the file that
  owns the list.
- **The most recent symptom, which 0.56.0 shipped:** the aggregate's rollback
  deleted adjuster sentences and left the key that says "I already said this",
  so `/cn why` lost the group-shared line, the "you are dead" line and the
  instance line after one rebuild â€” while the multipliers they described kept
  applying.
- **`/cn goal` did nothing to a quest already in your log, and `/cn ungoal`
  left its weighting behind.** Pinning changes the weight of a row without
  changing the row, so a provider that had not rebuilt took the
  unchanged-provider shortcut and the goals decorator never ran. Both
  persisted until that provider's list happened to change â€” which, standing at
  a vendor managing your goal list, is never.
- **A provider's row is never written into by the aggregate.** Two providers
  that know the same objective would raise the winner's value in place, with
  no way back: unpin a goal and the quest kept the pinned-era value for the
  session. Worse, the raised value then differed from the fresh one on every
  pass, so that provider could never take the unchanged-provider shortcut
  again â€” one shipped provider was measured rebuilding on 31 of 31 passes
  while the player stood still.
- **The Warband bank forgot every tab but one after each reload.** The
  per-container record 0.56.0 added lived in memory only, so the first time
  you opened a bank in a new session it threw away everything on disk except
  the tab the client happened to be describing â€” and reported the remains as
  freshly scanned. The record is per container on disk now, and "seen Nh ago"
  is the age of the stalest part of it rather than of the newest.
- **Data the addon refused to destroy stopped being mentioned one login
  later.** The refusal was recorded, the data was set aside â€” and the next
  login found the empty space where it had been, succeeded, and cleared the
  record. `/cn rescued` shows what is there and discards it when you say so;
  until then `/cn navdiag` and `/cn selftest` both keep saying it exists.

### Changed

- **"I don't know where it is" no longer beats "I can see it from here".** An
  objective with no coordinates was charged 3 for the journey; the far side of
  your own zone costs about 3.3. Measured on a real collection: twenty of the
  top thirty recommendations had no location at all. Two states are now
  distinguished â€” a currency or a reputation is not *anywhere*, so there is no
  journey to charge for, while a quest whose coordinates have not resolved is
  somewhere the addon cannot name and is charged the pessimistic figure, the
  same way an uncostable journey already was.

### Performance

Every figure below is measured, at a realistic scale: 300 candidates, a full
quest log, 160 located objectives in one zone, a 59-node flight network.

- **Routing a zone re-ranked the entire addon, every time, whether anything
  had moved or not.** The Zone tab refreshes every two seconds, the map does
  it on every open, and follow mode does it every three â€” so the ranked list
  had a hit rate of **zero** for as long as any of those was open. Thirty
  ticks produced thirty full re-ranks, 4,590 scorings and no hub changes.
  1.34ms per tick, returned.
- **The ranked sort built two strings per comparison**, and ties are the
  common case rather than the edge case â€” 134 of 153 candidates share a score
  with an earlier one. 943 comparisons per sort, 1,886 strings: 0.35ms and
  4.1KB per re-rank, down to 0.12ms.
- **One bag update cost 1,022 client calls**, 144 of them exact duplicates:
  the scan asked whether each slot starts a quest and threw the answer away,
  then asked again. What an item *is* â€” a mount, a pet, a toy â€” is a property
  of the item and was re-asked per slot, so a 40-slot stack of one reagent
  asked forty times.
- **The route optimiser** now works from flat coordinate arrays with
  don't-look bits: 3.70ms to 3.11ms at ninety stops, exactly the same route.
- **The clustering grid** builds numeric cell keys instead of 1,600 strings:
  0.63ms to 0.20ms.
- **The journey search** reuses its three per-node buffers instead of
  allocating 8.3KB per call, and the costing cache stopped allocating a
  closure before its own lookup.
- **The client is asked where you are once a frame**, not twenty-three times
  per rebuild â€” each of which allocated a vector in the client. The *map* is
  still asked every time, because walking into a building changes it without
  you moving.
- **The Remaining tab recounted three thousand achievement rows and eighteen
  hundred pets every two seconds** for numbers that change only when you
  collect something. Cached behind the events that announce a collection.
- **Learned task durations** are no longer re-sorted once per candidate.

### Internal

- Four of the eleven performance budgets could not fail: two measured the
  cached branch of the path they were guarding, and two fed the route
  optimiser a fixture a quarter the size of a real zone. All four now measure
  what a player triggers.
- A build-time check that nothing outside `Scoring.lua` writes into a reason
  list.
- Fifteen new mutations and eleven new assertions. Mutation score: 142 of 142.


## [0.56.0]

An adversarial review of everything 0.55.0 changed, a pass over the words the
addon puts in front of you, and two features from the backlog. Four of the
defects below were introduced by the release that was supposed to make things
correct, and are named as such.

### Added

- **Work your group shares ranks higher.** The addon has known you are in a
  group since 0.44.0 and used it for exactly one thing: pushing solo detours
  down while you are in a dungeon. Four people standing in a zone and one of
  the six quests on the list is one all four are carrying â€” that one is worth
  four times the work, every player already knows it, and the addon had the
  information and said nothing. It reads your own client about people already
  in your group, so nothing is sent, no other machine has to be running this
  addon, and outside a group it says nothing at all. `/cn why` names the
  count.
- **The Warband bank.** The account-wide bank tabs were never read. They are
  now, as a **separate** store from your character's own bank, because the two
  are different claims: one is reachable by this character, the other by every
  character on the account, and reachability is the addon's whole subject.
- **Every empty tab says what would fill it.** A tab with nothing to show drew
  literally nothing â€” a one-line header above 380 pixels of void, which reads
  as broken rather than as empty. Each one now names the step that fills it.
- **Sixteen more buttons have tooltips**, including "Re-route", "Refresh" and
  "Next step" â€” the three whose labels say least about what they do.

### Fixed

- **A pinned goal's weighting compounded on every rebuild, without bound.**
  The goals decorator read its own field and added eight to it â€” harmless
  while every rebuild produced fresh objects, and not harmless since 0.55.0
  started reusing them. After twenty quest turn-ins a pinned goal outweighed
  everything else on the list by thirty to one, `/cn next` returned it and
  nothing could displace it â€” including something about to despawn â€” and
  `/cn breakdown` showed the inflated figure as though it were deliberate.
  Only a reload cleared it. Unpinning now gives the weight back too, which it
  never did.
- **The first rebuild after a decoration deleted every explanation on an
  objective, permanently.** Rolling the reason list back to what the provider
  said is right; leaving the bookkeeping that says "I already said this" in
  place is not, because nothing could then say it again. The multipliers those
  sentences described went on applying, so `/cn why` printed a score with
  nothing under it. The new group-shared line was the most visible casualty:
  it appeared for exactly one rebuild.
- **A sentence carrying a number froze at the first number.** Three party
  members leaving one at a time left "3 others here are on this quest" on
  screen while the ranking tracked the truth.
- **Every learned task duration was collapsing to a twentieth of a second.**
  A journey estimate saturates at exactly 1200 seconds; 0.55.0 rejected any
  span over exactly 1200 as implausible. The window in which a far-away
  objective could produce anything but the floor was arithmetically empty, so
  every cross-zone completion stored 0.05s, the median settled at 0.05s, and
  `/cn plan` reported a zone as four minutes of work â€” confidently, because
  0.05 is not nil. An estimate the model will not stand behind is no longer
  subtracted at all, and the floor is gated on the measured span rather than
  on the estimate.
- **A quest two providers knew about accumulated every state it had ever been
  in.** The merge of one provider's reasons onto another's rows was harmless
  only by accident: the comparison that decides "this provider returned the
  same rows" always failed, so the merged set was rebuilt every pass.
  Repairing that comparison in 0.55.0 made the union permanent, and `/cn why`
  printed "available to pick up", "quest is ACTIVE" and "ready to turn in"
  about the same quest, at the same time.
- **The journey estimate was frozen at the first sighting.** It was stamped
  once, from wherever the addon thought you were when the objective first
  appeared on the list, and never revised â€” so an objective you flew to and
  finished was measured against a cost from the continent you left, and
  discarded. It is re-costed as you close on it now; the clock is not, because
  that is the measurement.
- **The dedup raised the winner's value into its live row and could not let
  go.** Unpin a goal and the quest kept the pinned-era value for the rest of
  the session, and the losing provider could stop emitting the row entirely
  with the number still there.
- **Saying the unlock count changed did not make anything recompute it.** The
  guard added for this was correct and unreachable: the decorator only
  consults it when a provider re-decorates, which the unchanged-provider
  shortcut skips, which is the normal case.
- **The Warband bank ended up holding whichever tab you looked at last.** The
  client does not describe a bank tab until it has been switched to, and the
  scan rewrote the whole store from what it could see â€” so moving one item at
  the bank rewrote both banks from whatever happened to be visible.
- **The shared-quest count asked the client once per candidate per ranking
  pass.** Measured at 8,151 client calls and 7.2ms for one pass in a
  forty-person raid, against a 0.4ms budget â€” the cache was keyed on the very
  thing that triggers a re-rank, so it was cleared exactly when it would have
  been used.
- **A quest's unlock count froze for the session** â€” on the second-heaviest
  term in the ranking, with `/cn why` stating a number the addon knew was
  wrong. Same cause: rows are reused now, and the decorator's "already set,
  leave it" guard made the first answer permanent.
- **A caching provider's rows collected a decorator's sentence once per
  rebuild.** The boundary between "what the provider said" and "what the addon
  added" was recorded blindly, so it crept upward every pass.
- **`/cn keepfilter off` did not clear the filter it was turning off.** The
  command looked the window up by the wrong name, so the branch never ran â€” it
  printed "a filter that persists invisibly is how a list looks empty when it
  is not" while leaving exactly that filter in memory. The checkbox in the
  window always worked.
- **`/cn help <word>` did not search aliases.** The worked example in the
  code's own comment â€” half-remembering "the one about lockouts" â€” was the
  exact query that returned nothing, because `lockouts` is an alias. Forty-nine
  aliases were invisible to the search.
- **A deferred objective could not be individually restored.** `/cn hidden`
  printed the time left and not the id, and `/cn unhide` matches on the id.
- **A corrupt character table was silently replaced with an empty one** â€” every
  character profile destroyed, version advanced, clean bill of health reported.
- **The harvest sorted its entire store on every captured quest** once at the
  ceiling, inside a loop over your whole quest log at login.
- **Rebuilding the tab strip could move you off the tab you were reading** and
  discard what you had typed in the search box.
- **A quest data provider that re-registers keeps its place in the queue**
  rather than dropping to the back of its priority band and silently handing
  over which addon answers first.

### Changed

- **The addon's internal vocabulary stopped reaching you.** `State:
  REQUIRES_OTHER_CHARACTER` now reads "another character has to do this". The
  Zone tab's header said "3 collectible, 2 exploration, 7 quest" â€” the type
  enum, lowercased, with the wrong plural. "No eligibility checker registered
  for CURRENCY" named a registry you have never heard of. "The Mounts module
  is not loaded" named a file.
- **The ranking weight and the focus stopped sharing a name.** `/cn mode` said
  "Focus: Collecting" and `/cn order` said "Focus: collections" about two
  different settings in the same session.
- **The first-run screen describes the focuses the same way every other
  surface does.** It carried its own four descriptions, all of which had
  drifted â€” and one was wrong: it called Levelling "quests first, collections
  quiet" when Levelling hides seventeen of the nineteen types. Quiet and gone
  are not the same promise.
- **It also names the focus you picked**, rather than the internal key: the
  button marked "Reputation" answered "Focus: reputation", and "Levelling"
  answered "Focus: leveling".
- **`/cn list` explains an empty list** the way the other five surfaces that
  show one already did, instead of being a dead end.
- **The required first step is no longer printed in the disabled grey.**
- **One grammar for a number that is not a measurement.** "roughly X to Y" and
  "(searched on Normal)" were two more private dialects beside the convention
  built for exactly this. The build now fails on a new one.
- **One unit per quantity.** `/cn plan` said "Planning 45 minutes" and then
  "32m of the 45m you have", four lines apart.
- **Ignore and Defer name the way back**, and Defer says how long.
- **The window's geometry agrees between tabs**: one header size, one button
  baseline, one gap, one list inset. None of it is visible on one tab and all
  of it is visible when you click between them.

### Internal

- The offline harness can now model a group, a shared quest, and a Warband
  bank tab, so all three are asserted through the path the game takes.
- A build-time check that a number which is not a measurement is hedged in the
  addon's one convention rather than in a private phrasing.
- A migration that refuses to destroy data it cannot read is no longer undone
  by the defaults merge three lines later, which replaced the same value and
  erased the evidence.
- Twenty-five new mutations and nineteen new assertions. Mutation score: 134
  of 134.


## [0.55.0]

An adversarial review of everything 0.54.0 changed, plus the registry
contracts and the data the addon keeps about you. Four of the defects below
were shipped by the release that was supposed to make things faster, and are
named as such.

### Fixed

- **Learned durations were biased long, and said so confidently.** A
  completion faster than the addon's own travel estimate was clamped up to a
  floor of 0.05 seconds -- and then discarded by a test on the very next line
  that rejected anything at or below 0.05. Every sample the floor existed to
  preserve was thrown away, which is the precise bias the floor was written to
  remove. Every `/cn plan`, every hub estimate, every "this will take" line
  read long. The order of the two tests is now correct: reject the
  implausible span first, floor what survives.
- **Half the addon's subject matter was being demoted for the addon's own
  deafness.** Preference learning counted a "sighting" for every objective
  type but could only count an "action" for the five the client announces --
  quests, achievements, pets, mounts and toys. The other thirteen crossed the
  observation threshold with a numerator nailed to zero, settled permanently
  on the 0.80 penalty, and `/cn learned` reported "you rarely act on these" --
  a claim about the player that the addon had no way to make. Only types with
  a completion path are credited now; the rest are left alone, and the rows
  that could never have been earned are dropped on upgrade.
- **A zone whose size the client would not report became one stop.** The
  0.54.0 clustering grid compares squared distances against the hub radius in
  yards. When the map scale was unavailable the fallback left distances in map
  units, where the largest possible value is smaller than the radius squared
  by three orders of magnitude -- so every objective in the zone joined the
  first hub, with a batch bonus to match. The fallback is now the same
  2000-yard assumption the distance helper has always used, which also means
  `RouteLength` reports yards on that path instead of map units.
- **And the scale lookup could not tell a refusal from an answer.** The map
  scale helper returns `1, 1` when the client will not convert -- correct for
  the arrow, which uses only the ratio of the two, and useless for routing,
  which wants absolute yards. Routing validated it with "greater than zero",
  which `1` satisfies, so the fallback above could never fire for a real map
  during a loading screen -- the one situation it exists for. The helper now
  says whether its answer is a measurement.
- **The unchanged-provider shortcut was off for any provider a decorator had
  touched.** The comparison that decides "this provider returned the same
  rows" ran a freshly built list against the previously *decorated* one, so
  anything a decorator had added was present on one side and absent on the
  other and the comparison could only disagree. Measured at 0.2 ms per
  collect, every five seconds, for no change on screen.
- **A preference verdict was never withdrawn.** `/cn learned reset` reported
  "Forgotten. The ranking is back to its defaults." while `/cn why` went on
  printing "you rarely act on these" from the sentence stamped on cached
  objectives.
- **The clustering grid was inert on that same path**, so the optimisation it
  was written for -- one cell per hub radius -- degenerated to the quadratic
  scan it replaced.
- **`ADDON_LOADED` handlers were accepted and never called.** The event is in
  the registry and `RegisterEvent` takes a handler for it; the dispatcher
  returned before dispatching. Anything registered that way ran never.
- **A migration that failed part-way printed one line and carried on.** The
  saved data was then in neither the old shape nor the new one, and every
  later login retried the same step against data it had already partly
  rewritten. The failure is recorded now, and `/cn navdiag` and `/cn selftest`
  say which step failed and why before reporting on anything read from that
  data.
- **Migration 8 could produce a store nothing could read** -- a key with no
  colon whose value was not a table was copied straight across, mixing two
  incompatible row shapes in one table.

### Changed

- **What a quest unlocks is now measured.** `unlockValue` carries the
  second-heaviest weight in the scorer and had exactly one producer out of
  twenty-two: a flat 1 for an item that teaches something. Every quest,
  reputation, profession and dungeon contributed nothing to it, so the term
  printed 0.00 and ranked nothing. It now reads the prerequisite graph the
  addon already harvests from your own play, inverted: how many quests have
  been observed sitting behind this one. A quest nothing has been seen behind
  still scores zero -- nothing is invented.
- **The harvest store evicts what it has not seen, not what is oldest.** It
  dropped the lowest quest IDs, on the reasoning that a low ID is old content.
  That describes a max-level character; it describes the exact opposite of an
  alt levelling through classic zones, whose entire log is low IDs -- so the
  store threw away the records for the zone that character was standing in and
  kept the main's endgame chains.
- **Any registered waypoint provider can be chosen.** The registry was open
  and the selector was not: `/cn nav` matched three names hardcoded in the
  command, so a fourth provider could be used automatically and never picked
  deliberately. The command now offers what is actually registered.
- **The window reopens on the tab you left, by name.** It stored an array
  index into a list that is sorted and rebuilt whenever a tab registers, so
  adding a tab silently moved everybody's remembered position.
- **The arrival prompt can fire again.** It latched once per zone per session,
  so clearing a zone, crossing a continent and coming back four hours later to
  the quests you left behind was met with silence -- the moment it is most
  useful, and the one moment it could not fire. Two hours, and a deliberate
  rescan clears it.
- **The harvest store counts before it allocates.** Pruning built its sort
  array before checking whether there was anything to prune, on every single
  captured quest -- and quests are captured in a loop over the whole log at
  login.
- **Quest data providers sort deterministically.** The priority list was
  re-sorted on every registration with a comparator that does not break ties,
  so two third-party providers that omit a priority could swap places because
  a third one registered -- silently changing which of them supplies a quest's
  name or coordinates.

### Internal

- Quest data providers must supply both halves of their contract. A provider
  registered without `IsAvailable` was accepted and then silently reported
  unavailable for ever, because the call on nil happened inside a `pcall`.
  Registering twice replaces rather than duplicating the priority row.
- Captures must be named. The name is the key the result is filed under, so a
  nameless one threw inside the capture run and took every later capture with
  it; a duplicate name silently overwrote another capture's result.
- `/cn why` re-runs the score adjusters, because an adjuster's contribution is
  recorded nowhere else. That is safe only while adjusters are idempotent, so
  the suite now asserts it -- and the re-run is guarded, so an adjuster that
  throws no longer takes the explanation with it.
- The offline test harness can now model the client REFUSING to convert a map
  position -- a loading screen, an instance, a map with no world position.
  Every fallback path in routing and navigation was unreachable from the
  suite until this release, which is why one of them shipped broken.
- Sixteen new mutations and eighteen new assertions covering the above.
  Mutation score: 109 of 109.


## [0.54.0]

Three audits: what it costs, what it looks like, and what the first five
minutes are actually like. The largest release this project has had.

### Added

- **One palette.** There were sixteen colours across five hundred and
  forty-three inline codes -- five near-identical greys doing one job, three
  reds, two greens, two golds, and the brand blue in two different casings --
  plus three separate colour tables, none of which was the source of truth.
  There are now eight roles in one file, every call site goes through a
  wrapper, and the test suite fails on a colour that is not one of them. It
  also fails if two roles become indistinguishable, which is how the five
  greys happened.
- **A settings page instead of seven checkboxes.** Twenty-one settings existed
  and seven were reachable in the window. The fourteen that were not included
  **both accessibility controls** -- text size and the colourblind arrow
  labelling -- so the players who most need a larger interface were the least
  likely to find it, since the only way in was typing `/cn scale 1.4`.
  Everything is now grouped by subject, and every control has a tooltip
  saying what it does.
- **A sort control.** Three sort modes were written, tested, and reachable
  from nowhere: the comment said "cycled by clicking the header" and nothing
  called it.
- **`/cn why` with no arguments** explains the current recommendation, which
  is what the word means. It used to print a usage line, while the addon
  computed exactly that answer and threw it away after `/cn next`.
- **A prompt on arriving somewhere.** The addon has always counted how many
  quests a zone holds that you have not picked up, and kept it to itself until
  you typed `/cn zone`. Once per zone, above a threshold, never mid-fight.
- **Per-tab footers** naming the two or three commands that go deeper from
  *that* tab. The window's only route to a hundred and twenty-five commands
  was one line pointing at `/cn help`.

### Changed

- **`/cn` answers the question the addon exists for.** It printed a status
  dump -- version, mode, and a list of all forty-seven internal module names
  -- and the login banner told every new player to type it. So the front door,
  advertised in the addon's own first line of output, answered a question
  nobody asked in vocabulary nobody shares. The status is still there, under
  `/cn status`.
- **The addon's name appears once per answer, not once per line.** Every line
  carried "Completion Navigator: ", and this addon answers in blocks -- six
  lines for `/cn next`, twenty for `/cn help`. Twenty-two characters of chrome
  per line turned every answer into a wall of the addon's own name.
- **Goals and chases accept names.** The store page leads with `/cn chase rep
  2600` and nobody knows that 2600 is the Severed Threads. Six modules had a
  name resolver; the two commands most likely to be handed a name called
  `CN.ToID` and refused anything that was not already a number.
- **Setup knows which scans have run**, not merely whether one did. The single
  flag meant the login reminder told players nothing had been scanned while
  four subsystems had scanned themselves eight seconds earlier, the window's
  own scan button did not satisfy it, and it could not name what was missing.
- **Three commands renamed.** `/cn nearby` meant "not near you"; it is
  `/cn elsewhere` now. `/cn waiting` read as "waiting on a timer" and meant
  unpicked quests; it is `/cn unpicked`. `/cn show` is `/cn types`, which is
  what it filters. All three keep their old names as aliases.
- **The essentials list is ten commands, all of them day-one.** It was
  fifteen, four of which were not.
- **The Blizzard options panel is a settings surface**, not a placard listing
  six commands and omitting the one required step.
- **The welcome screen offers the scan.** It arrived at the one moment a new
  player is engaged and looking at the addon, and offered four flavour presets
  and no way to do the thing that matters.

### Fixed

- **The tab strip was drawn on top of the filter box.** In the default
  configuration, on every install, two of the eleven tabs sat underneath the
  search field and its label.
- **The selected tab was rendered as a disabled button** -- greyed text,
  dimmed art. In every interface anywhere, greyed means unavailable, so the
  tab you were looking at was the one that looked broken.
- **The route optimiser cost 33 milliseconds and several megabytes of garbage
  per call** at the size a busy zone produces, and it runs every two seconds
  while the Zone tab is open. It built a whole new route table for every pair
  of stops and measured both routes end to end, including the one that had not
  changed. Reversing a segment alters exactly two edges, so the comparison is
  four distances and the swap happens in place. Same routes, no allocation.
- **Clustering was quadratic with a module lookup inside the inner loop** --
  10.7 ms at a hundred and ten objectives, growing as the square. The map
  scale is asked for once and candidates are bucketed into a grid, so only the
  nine cells around one can decide the answer.
- **Every located objective re-costed its journey from scratch on every
  rebuild.** Those are now memoised on the destination and thrown away when
  you move more than twenty yards.
- **The flight network was rebuilt after every loading screen** -- about ten
  milliseconds, on top of a provider rebuild, at the moment the client is
  busiest. Flight points cannot appear during a loading screen; only talking
  to a flight master adds one.
- **One click of Ignore cost 2.2 ms on every rebuild after it.** The hide
  lists were keyed on a `"TYPE:id"` string and read twice per candidate, so
  using the feature once meant eight thousand string allocations per rebuild
  -- for exactly the players the feature exists for. Nested by type now, which
  is two hash lookups and no string. Database version 9.
- **A volatile provider returning an identical list re-ranked everything.**
  Seven providers expire on a five-second clock and most of the time return
  precisely the rows they returned before; each one forced a full re-score.
  Measured, 0.007 ms became 0.221 ms, every five seconds, for no change.
- **The zone router scored every candidate and then threw the scores away**,
  twice: nothing in the function read them, and it invalidated the ranking
  immediately afterwards.
- **The benchmark was measuring a corner, not a continent.** Its sixty flight
  points were clustered into one corner of the map so they would not change
  any test's answer -- which is exactly the geometry the search's pruning
  bound rejects unexamined. One origin of fifty-nine survived there against
  seventeen of sixty on a real network, so two travel budgets were reported at
  a fifth of their ceiling while a realistic network was over both. The
  benchmark now spreads them after the assertions have run.
- **Nothing the addon drew over the game world had an outline.** The arrow's
  distance readout -- the number you read *while running* -- the heads-up
  line, the follow frame and the map pin numbers were all bare text with a
  one-pixel shadow, which is enough over a dark panel and not enough over
  Northrend snow.
- **The heads-up line and the follow frame had no background at all**, while
  the window used a Blizzard template and the welcome screen used parchment.
  Three idioms, and two of them read as text that had come loose.
- **Route pins were one bright arrow and eleven identical grey ones.** They
  are a sequence now: same colour, fading back, so "where next" is answerable
  without reading a digit. The arrow texture is still an arrow, which means
  *direction*, not *place* -- that is a further release.
- **Three tabs built their columns with `%-16s` padding in a proportional
  font**, which is not a column. Values are right-aligned in their own slot,
  and progress is a texture rather than a row of equals signs whose pixel
  width changed as it filled.
- **The completion flourish fired on every stop past the end of a route.**
- **`Appearances` had no refresh path at all** -- no event, no login hook --
  so it was read once by `/cn setup` and silently rotted from there.
- **Reputation scope corrections apply**: writing a faction to one scope now
  clears the other.
- Smaller: the harvest store had no ceiling and kept a map name it can derive
  from a map id; the preference cache was keyed on a string it rebuilt on
  every call and on a generation that changed every two seconds; `YES` and
  `NO` were shouting; type badges were plural on single items; the window
  reopens on the tab you left it on.

### Testing

- 95 mutations killed, none surviving, up from 81.
- The test stubs forgot what they were told: `SetWidth`, `SetSize` and
  `SetShown` all fell through to a catch-all, so nothing the addon sized or
  showed could be asserted about -- and an unset field read back as a *table*
  rather than as nil, which is how `GetWidth() or 400` returned a table.
- Coverage held at 85% across a release that added a file.


## [0.53.0]

Multi-hop flight routing, and three audits: how state lives and dies, how the
addon behaves when the client refuses, and whether what it prints is true.

### Added

- **Flight routes go through the network instead of across it.** The flight
  leg of a journey was the straight-line distance between two flight points,
  which is the one distance a taxi never travels: the bird hops from master to
  master, and a pair at opposite ends of a continent is reached through the
  ones in between. Measuring the hypotenuse understated every long flight, and
  always in the same direction, so distant objectives were systematically
  preferred over near ones. Routes are now the shortest path through an
  inferred flight graph, `/cn travel` prints the chain leg by leg, and a
  multi-hop estimate is never reported as measured -- the edge list is a
  model, and it says so.
- **`/cn handynotes`** lists what HandyNotes plugins are drawing on your map.
  The function behind it has existed since 0.41.0 with no caller.
- **`/cn rareforget`** clears the rares this character is assumed to have
  cleared. See below for why that assumption needed an escape hatch.
- **`/cn help flat`** prints the ungrouped listing. `ShowFullHelp` was written,
  exported and called from nowhere.

### Fixed

- **Ignoring or deferring an objective did nothing until something else
  happened.** The ignore list is read inside candidate providers, at build
  time, so it was baked into the cached list -- and none of the four mutators
  invalidated anything. It looked like it worked because most providers rebuild
  on some event within seconds; for `Mounts`, which waits on a new mount, an
  ignore could go unhonoured for the rest of the session with the dismissed row
  still at the top of the list.
- **Riding past a rare marked it cleared, permanently.** A vignette leaves the
  client's list for two completely different reasons -- somebody killed it, or
  you rode out of range -- and the addon assumed the first, with no expiry and
  no undo. That character was then never offered that rare again. Clearing now
  needs corroboration (the client said it was dead, or it vanished from within
  150 yards) and expires at the weekly reset.
- **An alt was shown its main's quest progress.** `IsQuestFlaggedCompleted`
  answers for the character asking, and the answer was being written into an
  account-wide store: a main that ran `/cn scanquests` wrote four thousand of
  its own completions into a table every alt read as its own, and scanning on
  the alt destroyed the main's record. The store is gone -- the client answers
  this for free, per character. The remembered quest locations had the mirror
  defect: one character finishing a zone deleted the locations for every other
  character who still had it to do.
- **An achievement you just earned was recommended again.** The store row was
  deleted and the shortlist revision was not, so the provider rebuilt, got the
  cached shortlist back, and re-emitted the completed achievement -- where it
  stayed until something unrelated moved the revision.
- **"You are dead -- this is for after" outlived being dead.** Adjusters stamp
  a sentence explaining the score they returned, onto objectives that live in
  the cache long after the situation does, and appending was the only operation
  there was. `/cn why` told living players their recommendation was for later.
- **Two providers rebuilt six times more often than they asked to.** `volatile`
  was a peer of the dirty check rather than subordinate to the cooldown, so
  `Waiting` -- which walks the mail inbox, the bags, the heirlooms and the
  currency store -- and `Instances` each declared thirty seconds and got five.
- **A quiet session erased the record of a bad one.** The error log was written
  on every logout including when it was empty, so the exact sequence the
  feature exists for -- something breaks, the player reloads before thinking to
  look -- destroyed its own evidence.
- **The map still showed stops you had just hidden.** The pin cache was keyed
  on the candidate generation, and hiding an objective type deliberately does
  not move that. `/cn zone` and the map disagreed about the same route.
- **A pinned goal appeared twice and inflated its own hub.** Providers dedupe
  their own lists; the aggregate concatenated them. Two copies of one objective
  share a position exactly, so the route reported a hub of two for one real
  stop and paid a batching bonus for a batching that does not exist.
- **The HandyNotes integration could not work for anyone who has HandyNotes.**
  `IteratePlugins` returns a `pairs`-style triplet and the addon captured only
  the first value, which throws. The test stub was a single closure -- the one
  shape under which the broken form works.
- **The Adventure Guide was asked with the wrong id.** `GetSavedInstanceInfo`
  returns the lockout id in slot 2 and the journal's instance id in slot 14;
  the addon stored the first and handed it to the journal, so "which bosses are
  left" always answered that there was no boss list. The fixture had journal
  ids in slot 2, so the stub and the code shared one wrong belief.
- **Your Pet Journal filters were reset every thirty seconds.** The file's own
  comment said the source and type checks were widened "only if the scan would
  otherwise see nothing"; the code did it on every scan, and the pet scan runs
  on a timer. Neither checkbox has a getter, so it could not be undone. It now
  happens only when the journal genuinely reports nothing, and says so out loud
  when it does. The Toy Box had the same defect.
- **"Waypoint set" was printed whether or not one was.** The provider's answer
  was discarded and `true` returned unconditionally -- on maps the client
  refuses waypoints on, with TomTom absent, and whenever the client would not
  build a map point. `C_Map.CanSetUserWaypointOnMap` exists to say which maps
  refuse and was called nowhere in the addon.
- **Clearing waypoints deleted pins you placed by hand.** There is exactly one
  user waypoint and it is the player's unless this addon set it; `/cn clearway`
  and stopping follow mode both removed it unconditionally.
- **Currencies under a collapsed header were invisible.** The list counts only
  rows under expanded headers, exactly like the reputation list -- which the
  addon has handled since 0.30.0. Collapse your profession group, which most
  people have, and every currency under it vanished from `/cn currencies`,
  `/cn clock` and the weekly-cap warnings.
- **One collapsed reputation header collapsed them all.** Captured under
  `factionID or index` and restored on `factionID` alone; headers carry
  factionID 0, so they all collided.
- **`/cn setup` recorded success when every scan had failed**, which stopped the
  login reminder and made `/cn setup check` answer that everything was scanned.
  A module that threw was also reported with the word "unavailable" -- a defect
  presented as a missing feature.
- **A repeating timer that threw produced a repeating error box.** Five
  callbacks -- the auto-advance ticker, the session observer, follow mode's
  tick, the world map hooks and the broker's click and tooltip -- were
  unguarded. The broker's ran inside the host bar addon.
- **`/cn next` told new players the addon was quests-only.** A leftover from an
  early build, printed on the most likely first thing anyone sees, and false
  since the second release. All four empty-state messages now come from one
  explanation that can also distinguish "nothing to do" from "the engine
  threw" -- which previously looked identical.
- **`/cn where am i` could not be typed.** The dispatcher splits on the first
  space, so a registered, documented, multi-word command was unreachable.
- **`/cn zones` ran a different command than its help text described.** It was
  registered as a command and, further down the same file, as an alias of
  `/cn loremaster`; the alias loaded later and won. Registration now records
  collisions and the test suite fails on them.
- **The welcome window's "a bit of everything" set nothing** while printing
  that it had -- and left every type hidden if a focus was already active.
- **Three of the ten "weighting only" modes silently applied filters**, because
  they exist in both tables and the preset is tried first. `/cn mode profile
  <name>` now asks for the weighting alone.
- **An unknown expiry was printed as "expired"**, so a live world quest sat at
  the bottom of a list headed "soonest to expire", labelled expired.
- **An imported quest chain was reported as observed on zero characters.** The
  edges carried no origin, so the eligibility line asked the harvest store --
  which has no record of an imported quest -- and printed the zero as evidence.
- **The exploration percentage was computed against the addon's own scan** and
  read as the world. The module's header says a real one is uncomputable; the
  code printed one anyway. The counts remain.
- **Raw enums were shown where a label belongs** -- `(ACHIEVEMENT)` in `/cn
  next`, and `MOUNT` as the broker's name in Titan Panel and ElvUI.
- **The follow-mode completion flourish fired on every stop past the end.**
- **`CN.Guard` changed the arity of what it wrapped**, truncating at a trailing
  nil.
- **The bearing shim had no callers.** `CN.Mod` is documented as the mandatory
  floored modulo and the one place that wraps an angle used two unbounded
  `while` loops instead.
- Nine smaller corrections: a fabricated battle-pet denominator, a hardcoded
  English string two lines from its own translation, `/cn order` clamping
  silently, a help entry that printed nothing, `/cn who` promising name
  resolution for four types and supporting two, `/cn percharacter` listing four
  of six overridable settings, a durations formatter rendering twenty-five
  seconds as "0m", two error messages naming commands that cannot do what the
  message says, and an inert `enabled` setting nothing had ever read.

### Changed

- **Persistence pruned again.** The quest-status store is gone entirely (the
  client answers it for free), the harvest store no longer keeps a map name it
  can derive from a map id, and it has a ceiling for the first time -- it was
  the largest thing the addon saved and the only large store with no bound.
  Database version 8.
- **Reputation scope corrections apply.** Writing a faction to one scope now
  clears the other, so a faction Blizzard moves between account-wide and
  character-specific cannot leave a stale row winning forever.
- The `/cn locale` report now says what it is a report about: the recurring
  strings routed through the locale table, not every line the addon prints.
- The Collections tab says its percentages are of the last scan.
- `/cn warband` puts its caveat on the number rather than only on the
  one-character case.

### Testing

- 81 mutations killed, none surviving, up from 67.
- Coverage floor raised from 82% to 85%, closing a backlog item open since
  0.31.0. `Alts` went from 49.6% to 73.5%; the TomTom and HandyNotes providers,
  the key bindings, the minimap button and the whole window rebuilt with every
  Blizzard template retired are now exercised.
- The fixture audit no longer prints a count that reads as coverage when three
  of its seven rules were skipped for want of a recording. It names them.
- The API-surface extractor no longer harvests example code out of comments,
  which had made one of those rules permanently unpassable.
- The stubs for the currency list, the reputation headers, the pet and toy
  filters, the user waypoint, the saved-instance tuple and the HandyNotes
  iterator were all more forgiving than the client. They are not now.


## [0.52.0]

The backlog, reconciled item by item against the shipped code rather than
against its own status tags -- and then the buildable half of what that
reconciliation found still outstanding.

### Fixed

- **Nine languages were shipping English for strings that had already been
  translated.** Forty-six strings were carried in ten locale files and only
  seventeen were ever looked up. The arrow's own words -- *ahead*, *veer*,
  *turn*, *back* -- were printed as English literals, and so were "Stop 3 of 8
  cleared", "Route complete.", the confidence qualifier that wraps every
  uncertain number in the addon, and the situation line. Thirteen more had no
  display anywhere at all: translated into ten languages, passing every lint,
  appearing on no screen.
  
  The existing lint only ever asked whether a translation matched a key and
  whether a key had a translation. Neither question is *does anything show
  this*. It is asked now, and the build fails on a string nothing displays.
  The thirteen orphans have been removed rather than kept, because a list of
  translated strings is a claim about what has been translated, and one that
  counts strings nobody sees makes that claim false in the direction that
  flatters it.

### Added

- **A ghost is pointed at their body.** The addon has recognised death since
  0.43.0, ranked everything else down for it, and printed *"your body first"*
  -- while being unable to say where the body is. The client answers that
  directly and was never asked. The corpse is now an ordinary recommendation,
  so the arrow, the map pin, `/cn go` and the heads-up display all pick it up
  without any of them needing to know what a corpse is; it keeps its full
  weight while everything else is ranked down, and no display filter can hide
  it.
- **A non-mage can be told how long another continent takes.** A
  cross-continent journey can only be costed through a teleport whose landing
  place is known, and eight of the fourteen the addon tracks carried none --
  including the hearthstone, which everybody has. Five of those eight had no
  destination for no better reason than that nobody had filled it in.
  Costable teleports go from six to eleven; the remaining three say why they
  cannot be pinned rather than being given a plausible-looking false landing.
- **The colourblind mode now changes the colours.** It added a word beside the
  arrow -- which satisfies "no information carried by colour alone" and left
  the palette exactly as unusable as it was. Gold against red is the worst
  pair there is for the commonest form of colour blindness, and it was
  carrying *drifting* against *walking away*: the one distinction the arrow
  exists to make. The alternate palette separates by lightness as well as
  hue, and the build checks the separation rather than trusting the eye.
- **`/cn cues` fires at the two moments it was written for.** It was described
  as sound and a flash when a route finishes, and that is all it did -- while
  the moments a player actually wants marked are the smaller ones: arriving
  somewhere, and clearing a stop. All three now, quieter for the small ones.
- **`TRANSLATING.md`**, and a line in `/cn locale export` saying where to send
  the block. The tool half of that workflow has existed since 0.39.0 and the
  return path was written down nowhere, so a translator finished the work and
  then had to guess -- which is where most people stop.
- **`cn.ps1 provenance` names the rows worth checking** instead of counting
  them and telling you to go and look.

### Changed

- **A curated turn-in location now beats the client's moving waypoint** for a
  quest that is ready to hand in. The lookup was written when the three-phase
  quest model was designed -- *"a quest is a pick up, a do, and a turn in"* --
  and was called by nothing, so the third phase, the one the design rests on,
  has always used a waypoint that points at whatever the quest currently wants
  rather than at the person who takes it back.
- **A drop's difficulty is no longer stated as though it were the drop's.**
  The label came from the Encounter Journal's *currently selected* difficulty
  -- a window the player may have opened once and left on Normal -- so a
  Mythic-only mount was confidently labelled Normal. The client offers no
  per-item difficulty, so it now says what was actually searched.

### Not done, and why

Multi-hop flight routing is a day's work through the code path two previous
releases' performance and correctness guards both sit on, and is the right
first thing for the next release rather than a rushed addition to this one.
Reading the Warband bank cannot be verified against a real container list from
here. A cross-tab search is a decision the author declined in writing and it
stays declined until he says otherwise. Screenshots for the store page, the
in-game arrow verification, the Wago project id and the curated quest data all
need a live client or an account this build cannot reach.

## [0.51.0]

An audit of **whether the numbers are right** -- not whether the code runs,
but whether the answers it gives are true. Fourteen findings. A confidently
wrong number is worse than no number, and several of these were confidently
wrong in the direction that made the addon's advice actively bad.

### Fixed

- **A focus made the thing you asked for rank LOWER, as soon as it was more
  than a few minutes away.** Everything went into one running total which was
  then multiplied -- and that total crosses zero, because travel is weighted
  against a cost reaching 40 while what finishing something is worth tops out
  around 8. Multiplying a negative number by 2.0 pushes it down. `/cn mode
  quests` ranked a distant quest **twenty-seven points below a distant pet**.
  The learned preference inverted the same way, promoting exactly the types it
  had decided you avoid. Worth and cost are now kept apart: a focus doubles
  what a thing is worth to you, and cannot reverse the sign of anything.
- **Every task time the addon learned contained the journey, which the planner
  then added again** -- once per objective at a stop, which is worst precisely
  where the router is trying to reward grouping work together. Four quests six
  minutes apart came out at **thirty-six minutes against a true twelve**,
  reported as confident. Learned times are now the work itself.
- **"Running the whole way" was costed at whatever speed you happened to be
  moving.** Asked while flying, it divided by your skyriding speed: a
  twenty-one thousand yard journey was quoted at **six minutes, labelled
  `run`, marked confident**, where the truth on foot is fifty. It also made
  the self-flown option unreachable while airborne -- the same divisor plus
  six seconds of takeoff can never win.
- **Another continent scored as CHEAPER to reach than the far side of the zone
  you are standing in.** The fallback for a journey the addon cannot model was
  25 while a journey it can model saturates at 40 -- so "I have no idea how to
  get there" outranked a quest two minutes away by fifteen points, nearly
  twice the entire range of what finishing something is worth. Vendors and
  toys were charged a flat 25 for the next zone while holding the seller's
  exact coordinates; they are costed properly now.
- **A player who did everything they were shown was told they do nothing.**
  Quests are counted under both their type and a campaign/side sub-bucket; the
  showing side incremented both and the completion side credited only the
  type. The sub-buckets collected sightings and never a single action, drifted
  to the floor multiplier -- and the ranking prefers the sub-bucket. Measured:
  120 quests offered, 120 turned in, `/cn learned` reporting **"0 of 60 acted
  on, x0.80, you rarely act on these."**
- **A reputation bar showed 100% for a goal half done.** Progress was reported
  inside the current rank and presented as progress toward the goal, so
  somebody at 21,000 of the 42,000 the ladder needs -- but one point from the
  top of Honored -- got a full bar. It also decided the order of `/cn chase`.
  The band is now reported as a count with the rank named, and no denominator
  is invented for the ladder, which is the rule this addon applies everywhere
  else.
- **A hundred-quest zone grind was advertised as a one-step job.** The client
  reports "complete 100 quests in X" as ONE criterion carrying a quantity;
  counting rows gave 0 of 1, so it was filed as "not started, 1 to do", sorted
  to the front of `/cn zones` as the smallest job available, and given the
  bonus for a small remainder.
- **`/cn travel` printed legs that did not sum to its own total.** The
  preference for a flight path you have flown before was applied to the
  duration rather than to the comparison, so the headline was ten percent
  short of the model's own arithmetic -- and that shortened number flowed into
  scoring and into `/cn plan`'s budget. Every player has flown somewhere, so
  this was the ordinary case.
- **"Stop 9 of 8 cleared."** The route is rebuilt from live candidates as you
  go, so it grows when you accept quests -- against a total frozen when you
  started. The completion moment fired at stop 8 and then again at 9, 10 and
  11 while stops remained, and the heads-up display stuck on "stop 8 of 8" for
  the rest of the session.
- **One nil answer from the client wiped your quest count for the day.** The
  two branches computing the day key returned numbers on different scales -- a
  day index of about 20,687 and a calendar number of 20,260,822 -- so a single
  miss during a loading screen read as a day rollover.
- **`/cn plan` justified its confidence with evidence from the wrong bucket**,
  citing forty-six speed samples for a flying median that came from six of
  them.
- **`/cn plan 5` would print "1 stop, about 45m"** with nothing saying the
  budget had been blown ninefold: the first stop was admitted unconditionally.
  It is still shown -- there may be nothing smaller -- and now it says so.

## [0.50.0]

An audit of **sequences** rather than files: login to logout to login again,
state machines entered and left, events arriving in the order the game sends
them. Ten findings, and the previous three audits could not have found any of
them by reading one file at a time.

### Fixed

- **The addon threw a Lua error into your chat frame on every login, and has
  never appeared in the game's own options list.** The registration reads
  `Settings.RegisterCanvasLayoutCategory` -- the client's options API since
  Dragonflight -- and `Settings` was also the name of a file-local function
  two hundred lines above it, so it indexed a function and threw. The error
  was caught and printed; because it aborted the function, the older fallback
  never ran either, which is why the addon has never been in that list at all.
  The test harness did not define the client's options API, so the guard
  short-circuited before the bad line. Same shape as the invented event name
  in 0.46.0: a stub more forgiving than the client.
- **`/cn why` repeated itself, more each time.** Scoring runs repeatedly over
  the same cached objectives, and adjusters appended their explanation on
  every pass -- one objective was measured carrying **sixty-two** reasons
  after thirty rounds of ordinary play, printing the same sentence sixty times
  over. This is the identical defect recorded as fixed for decorators; that
  fix was applied to decorators and nobody looked at the adjuster path, which
  runs far more often.
- **`/cn setup` told you it had scanned your mounts, toys, appearances and
  professions, and the recommendation could not see any of it.** Four of the
  eleven scans rewrote their store and left their own provider serving a cache
  built before the scan -- stale until a zone change, a level-up or the next
  login, which is exactly the first five minutes of a new install. The suite
  asserted the bug was correct: *"a mount scan must not rebuild candidate
  providers"*, true when mounts fed only the Collections tab and false from
  the day they became a source of recommendations.
- **Three of the six per-character settings could not be set by any input** --
  including `priorityMode`, the example the feature was built around. The
  command lowercased what you typed and looked it up in a table with camelCase
  keys, so it rejected the exact spelling its own help line prints.
- **`/cn mode fastest` still had an inert second lever.** 0.48.0 wired the
  learned-duration term and got two things wrong in one edit: the producer was
  registered as taking a list where the addon hands over one objective, and
  the whole block landed *inside* another function -- so it existed only as a
  side effect of calling that one, and re-registered itself on every call.
  Fifty-seven copies of the same producer in one session, none of which set
  the field. The suite hand-built objectives with the value already in them,
  testing the consumer against a fixture the producer never made.
- **`/cn mode off` with no focus set silently deleted your `/cn show`
  filters** while printing that it had restored them. Hidden types are saved
  to disk, so the loss was permanent. It now says nothing changed, because
  nothing did.
- **`/cn follow off` left the arrow on screen** pointing at a route nobody was
  walking, along with the map waypoint, the map pin and the navigation ticker
  -- it hid its own frame and cancelled its own timer and stopped there. It
  also left a combat deferral armed, which fired into the next quiet moment of
  a session that was no longer following anything.
- **Follow mode rebuilt the entire zone route on every quest-log update**
  whenever nothing routable was near you -- a capital city, a dungeon, a
  battleground, a flight. Measured: twenty events cost twenty full route
  builds with a 2-opt pass each, where a live stop costs zero.
- **Follow mode resumed at login never showed progress.** The route length was
  counted only when the command was typed, and at login the map API has not
  answered yet -- so every "Stop 3 of 8 cleared" degraded to a bare "Stop
  cleared" and the completion moment was unreachable for the entire session.
- **A goal pinned before the matching scan kept its placeholder name
  forever** -- "Currency 3008" in the goal list, in `/cn chase`, and after
  every future login, even once the client could name it. `/cn chase` pins
  automatically, so this needed no unusual sequence at all.

## [0.49.0]

A third end-to-end audit, over the subsystems the first two did not reach.
Twenty findings. **Six of them were whole features that had never once run**
-- written, documented at length, shipped, and silently off, in every case
because the failure was indistinguishable from an empty result.

Plus the thing that made the last four releases painful: the release workflow
now runs *here*, before a tag is cut.

### Fixed

- **Dungeon and raid lockouts have never produced a single recommendation.**
  The client reports the number of bosses and then how many you have killed;
  the addon read those two the other way round. A raid six bosses into eight
  came back as eight of six, so "remaining" clamped to zero, the lockout
  looked cleared, and the provider returned nothing. This module exists on the
  premise that a part-finished lockout is the cheapest progress in the game --
  spent effort with an expiry on it -- and it has never offered one. The test
  fixture had the same reversal written into its own comment, so the suite
  agreed with the bug.
- **Weekly profession knowledge has never appeared in `/cn clock`.** The
  lookup guarded on a function that does not exist and never has, so it
  returned an empty list on every client -- for the thing the file's own
  header calls "the most permanently missable in modern professions". An empty
  list and a list that cannot be built look identical from outside.
- **The addon was resetting your pet journal and toy box filters and not
  putting them back.** A scan has to widen the filters to see everything, and
  the comment above it has always said "and then put them back" -- it restored
  the search box and nothing else; the toy box restored nothing at all. Filter
  your journal to uncollected wild pets, run `/cn setup` once, and it was
  silently reset to show everything, permanently, with no message. That is the
  addon changing a setting you chose, which this project's standing rule
  forbids outright.
- **Your currencies have never been recorded.** The row the client returns for
  the currency list carries no id -- it has to be read from the row's link --
  and the addon read a field that is not there. Every row was dropped,
  `/cn currencies` has always said "no currency data yet", and the currency
  provider has always been empty. The stub returned rows that *did* carry the
  field, which is the ninth time in this project a stub and the code have
  shared one wrong belief.
- **A Warband currency capped on one character was still recommended on every
  other one** -- the exact mistake the Warband work exists to prevent, and
  which 0.43.0 recorded as fixed. The flag was read from the client correctly,
  stored correctly, and then dropped by the one function that builds the rows
  the provider reads.
- **The LibDataBroker feed was frozen at login.** Its refresh had exactly one
  caller, inside its own installer, which runs before the collection scans
  have populated anything -- so it was built from an empty database, settled
  on "nothing actionable", and never changed again for the rest of the
  session. It now updates whenever the recommendation list does.
- **Recipe counts were discarded on every login**, so opening a profession
  window to record them and then logging out produced "(nil of nil recipes)".
- **`/cn mode off` did not undo the mode.** Switching focus twice overwrote
  the saved state with the *first* focus's state, so `off` restored a preset
  rather than what you had -- while printing that your previous filters were
  restored, and leaving no single command to get back.
- **Near-complete achievements all reported "0 achievement points."** The
  field stopped being stored in 0.36.0; two other readers were updated and
  this one was missed, where `or 0` turned an absent number into a confident
  false statement. Points are now read live, or not mentioned.
- **`/cn export` wrote the same key twice** for any quest with both a provider
  answer and observed agreement, so Lua kept the second and the curated list
  was destroyed on the way into shipped data. It also wrote inference under
  the name reserved for curated fact -- the door the runtime path had already
  closed, still open on the path that actually ships data to other players.
- **BtWQuests was reported unavailable to anyone whose version had moved its
  database.** The probe walked three possible locations with `ipairs`, and the
  first is nil in exactly the case the other two exist for. The two
  interpreters do not even agree on the length of such a list.
- **`/cn where` attributed machine-learned coordinates to you.** Two callers
  pass where a location came from; the function did not declare the parameter.
- **The first-run window appeared on the same tick as the setup reminder**,
  in the order its own comment says must not happen, and reappeared on every
  login for anyone who read it without clicking a button.
- Two more: an ATT merge that took the last answer where every neighbouring
  field takes the first, and a calendar deadline gated on an unrelated
  function -- which silently dropped the urgency weighting from every world
  event on any client lacking it.

### Changed

- **The release workflow's own steps now run before a tag is cut.** Four
  consecutive releases were tagged, pushed, reported as published and never
  reached CurseForge, each failing at a different step -- and every one of
  them was reproducible in seconds locally. What the local suite ran were
  *equivalents*: the linter against one directory, the harness against
  another. The workflow runs them against a scaffolded tree from the
  repository root, and that difference is where all four failures lived. The
  build now extracts each step from the workflow file and executes it, in a
  scaffolded tree, with the client recording in place -- eleven of the
  thirteen, the two skipped being the ones that need a real tag push.
- **Retrying a failed release is one word.** A release whose build fails
  leaves its tag behind, so the retry is refused -- which happened four times,
  each time answered by two git commands typed by hand from a message that had
  scrolled past. `release <version> -Retag` replaces the tag and cuts it again.
- **The goal-zone rule is worked out once per rebuild** instead of once per
  goal per candidate, where it was making thousands of client calls on the
  path a previous release restructured specifically to stop doing work per
  objective.
- Dead weight removed: an achievement-category table written on every scan and
  read by nothing, a field whose name meant the opposite of its contents, and
  two command aliases that a later module had already taken.

## [0.48.1]

**0.46.0, 0.47.0 and 0.48.0 were tagged, pushed, and never published.** The
build failed at a step before the packager on all three, and the release
command reported success anyway. No addon code changed in this release; the
release pipeline did.

### Fixed

- **Every client recording this toolkit has ever written was malformed Lua,
  so the stub audit had never once run.** `cn.ps1 fixtures` emitted `return `
  followed by the *interior* of the capture table -- no braces -- producing a
  file beginning `return` and then a bare `["worldPosition"] = {`. The block
  extractor returns interiors on purpose, which is right for its two other
  callers and wrong here.
  
  Nothing said so. The harness treated an unparseable recording exactly like
  an absent one, printed *"no recording present, stubs are UNVERIFIED"* and
  passed; `check` reported *"stub audit backed by a recording"* on the
  strength of a regular expression that found a version number in the text.
  Both statements were false for as long as the feature has existed. The
  recording is now written with its braces, `check` requires the file to
  actually load, and a test writes one through the real command and loads it.
- **The audit's own achievement rule named an achievement no fixture has**,
  so the first time it ever ran against real data it reported the stub as
  simpler than the client. The stub was correct; the rule was not. It survived
  because no recording had ever parsed, so the rule had never executed.
- **A string in the addon was never translated, and the check said so for
  four releases.** `Stop %d of %d cleared` -- the line follow mode shows when
  you finish a stop on a multi-stop route -- was added to the canonical string
  list in 0.45.0 and handed to no translator, so every non-English player has
  been seeing English there. `check` printed *"1 of 46 strings have no
  translation in any locale"* on every run since and it was scrolled past
  every time, because it was a note. **A note nobody acts on is not a check.**
  A string translated in NO locale now fails the build and is named in the
  output; partial coverage stays a note, because a string in six languages
  and not the seventh is ordinary work in progress. All ten locales now carry
  it.
- **The canonical string list repeated itself.** `ready` and `another zone`
  were each listed twice from 0.45.0, so the list claimed 48 entries for 46
  strings and every coverage figure reported against it was wrong -- including
  the note above. Duplicates now fail.
- **A recording that will not parse no longer reads as no recording at all.**
  The harness loads `fixtures/captured.lua` and treated "the file is missing"
  and "the file is broken" identically, so a corrupt one printed *"stubs are
  UNVERIFIED"* and the run went green. The strongest test in this project
  would have been silently absent while a file sat in the repository claiming
  to provide it. It is now a hard failure that names the parse error.
- **A stray file under `fixtures/` is now reported.** The toolkit writes
  exactly one recording, `captured.lua`. Anything else there was put in by
  hand, is read by nothing, and can look like broken addon source to any tool
  that walks the tree.
- **`## X-Wago-ID:` sat in the `.toc` with no value.** The packager reads that
  header to decide whether to publish to Wago, and a blank value is a value --
  it is being asked to upload to a project id of `""`. An absent header is
  understood; an empty one has to be interpreted. The line is gone, and any
  `X-` header present with no value now fails the check.
- **A captured client recording failed the build.** `cn.ps1 fixtures` writes
  `fixtures/captured.lua` -- evidence read only by the test harness, and the
  thing that makes the stub audit possible at all. It is a `.lua` file sitting
  in the repository, so the build step that verifies every Lua file is listed
  in the `.toc` reported it as missing and exited non-zero, before the
  packager ran. The failure began the moment the first recording was committed
  and repeated on every release after it.
- **Four separate lists decide what counts as addon source** -- the toolkit's
  file scanner, the build workflow's search, luacheck's exclusion list and the
  packager's ignore list -- and 0.47.0 taught only the first one about
  `fixtures/`. Fixing three of the four moved the failure from the `.toc` step
  to the Lint step rather than curing it, which is the same mistake a second
  time in the same hour. That is a fix
  applied to the instance somebody noticed instead of to the class, which is
  the same mistake this project's comments have described twice already. All
  three now agree, and a test scaffolds a tree with a recording in it and
  fails if any of them disagrees.
- **The recording would have shipped inside the addon.** The packager's ignore
  list did not mention `fixtures`, so a copy of one machine's client evidence
  was going into every player's AddOns folder. `mutate.sh` was going with it.
- **`cn.ps1 release` claimed an upload it cannot see.** It printed "Pushed
  vX. GitHub Actions packages and uploads to CurseForge" in green -- a
  statement about the future, formatted as an outcome. That line is why three
  failed releases were reported as live. It now says what it actually did:
  the push happened, nothing is published, and the build has to pass first.

## [0.48.0]

A second end-to-end audit, aimed at the parts 0.47.0 did not reach: the
scorer, the router, the planner and the caches. Twelve findings. Four of them
were features that had been silently off -- in one case since the release that
introduced them.

### Fixed

- **Measured flight speed never survived a reload.** The save routine wrote
  two of the three speed buckets and left out `flying`, while the load routine
  read all three. Since the travel model requires five flying samples before
  it will consider a self-flown route at all, every logout turned self-flying
  back off -- the feature 0.43.0 was built around, off for everyone, for five
  releases. The suite tested disk-to-memory for all three buckets and
  memory-to-disk for two, each against a fixture the other half never
  produced. Testing each half separately is not testing the round trip.
- **Five providers were subscribed to events nothing dispatched.** Providers
  declare which events invalidate them; the scorer held a separate
  hand-written list of the events it actually listened for. Nine declared
  events were on no such list -- and declaring an unwired event is *worse*
  than declaring none, because a provider that names events is skipped by any
  event it did not name. Orders and Inventory therefore never refreshed after
  login: **a quest-starting item you looted did not become a recommendation,
  and a crafting order you collected stayed on the list until you reloaded.**
  The scorer now subscribes to whatever the providers declare. There is one
  list.
- **Follow mode could stall on a finished stop.** Its cache of what is still
  actionable was keyed on a counter that only a rebuild advances -- and the
  cache returned early *before* triggering the rebuild. Once the two
  converged, nothing on that path ever rebuilt again, so the counter could
  never move and the cache never expired. It came unstuck only if some other
  part of the addon happened to rebuild. The guard was saving about two
  microseconds.
- **Routes were ordered as though every zone were square.** Ordering, the
  2-opt improvement pass and the reported route length all worked on raw map
  coordinates, which run 0 to 1 on both axes whatever the zone's real shape.
  In an ordinary 3000-by-1500-yard zone a stop 300 yards east compared as
  further away than one 165 yards north, and the optimiser then confidently
  improved a distance that was not the distance. **This is the same
  square-map assumption as the bearing defect of 0.40.0**, eight releases
  later, in the last file still making it -- while another function in that
  very file converted properly, so clustering and routing disagreed with each
  other.
- **Routing one zone left every objective in it scored as batched, forever.**
  The batch bonus is written onto live objectives at the end of a zone route
  and was never cleared, so it followed them into the ranked list and into
  every later zone. The ranking cache was not invalidated either, so
  `/cn next` served scores from before the batching that `/cn zone` was
  showing: two commands contradicting each other about the same objectives.
- **`/cn order` did not print the arithmetic `/cn next` had done.** It left
  out the focus multiplier and every registered adjustment, having promised in
  its own comment that "if the two ever disagree, this is wrong". In
  `/cn mode quests` it printed a headline of 6.0 above terms summing to 3.0.
  The test that was supposed to catch this checked one synthetic objective in
  the one mode where both omissions happen to be no-ops.
- **The session planner cherry-picked stops** out of a route ordered to
  minimise walking -- the thing the comment above it explains at length that
  it must not do -- and costed the stops after a skipped one from the wrong
  position. It now stops at the first stop that does not fit, and reports how
  much of the route is left rather than how many stops overran.
- **`/cn mode fastest` had only one of its two advertised levers.** The scoring
  term for how long something takes was declared, summed, printed and
  overridden by that mode -- and nothing had ever set it. The addon has been
  measuring how long each kind of objective takes you since 0.41.0; that is
  now wired to the term, scaled so a value of 1 means "about as long as things
  usually take", and an objective the addon has never timed still contributes
  nothing rather than a guess.
- **Three more scoring inputs that nothing produced** -- difficulty,
  prerequisites, and a second nearby term -- have been removed. Each was
  summed on every objective, listed in the documented formula and printed by
  `/cn order`, and contributed exactly zero to every score the addon has ever
  computed.
- **`/cn mode legacy` did nothing.** It was an empty profile, offered in the
  mode list and accepted by the command, behaviourally identical to balanced.
- **The harvest summary counted a field that a database migration deletes.**
  It reported zero inferred prerequisites on every database in existence,
  including databases full of them -- a reader that outlived its field by four
  schema versions.
- **Two contradictory comments in one function**, and a rules block that
  described the opposite of what the code below it did. In both cases the code
  was right; the prose has been corrected rather than the behaviour.
- **Five functions that nothing called** have been deleted, and the count of
  the rest is now printed and capped, so the number cannot quietly grow. Dead
  code in this addon has twice turned out to be a missing wire rather than
  untidiness.

## [0.47.0]

An end-to-end audit of the whole addon, run the way the last release taught:
assume the test suite is more forgiving than the game. Six defects, every one
of them invisible to a suite that otherwise passes eighty files, two
interpreters and thirty-seven mutations.

### Added

- **The addon now knows which client functions it calls, and can tell you
  which of them are gone.** 0.46.0 shipped an event name that does not exist;
  the client throws on those, so it announced itself. Client *functions* fail
  silently instead: every call site is guarded with `if C_Thing and
  C_Thing.Method`, which is correct, and which makes a renamed or misspelled
  name indistinguishable from a client that lacks the feature -- the guard
  goes false, the branch never runs, and the feature is dead for as long as
  nobody notices. The list of the 198 names this addon uses is now **generated
  from the source** at build time, `/cn selftest` reports any the client no
  longer has, and `/cn capture` records them for the offline suite to fail on.
  A hand-written list of what the code calls is a second copy of the code, so
  nobody writes this one.

### Fixed

- **The route search could return the second-best route.** The bound that lets
  it skip hopeless flight points was documented as exact "because every
  remaining term of the sum is positive". Every term is -- but the sum is then
  *multiplied* by a discount for a flight path you have actually flown, and a
  discount is not a term. A route up to a tenth cheaper than the bound
  predicted could be discarded unexamined. The test written to catch exactly
  this brute-forced the answer honestly and still missed it, because no flown
  routes had been recorded at that point in the run: the discount was never
  live while the comparison ran. It would have affected every player who has
  ever taken a flight path, and no fixture.
- **Nothing ever recorded whether a zone allows flying.** The store was
  written, commented at length -- *"remembering the answer per zone turns that
  guess into evidence"* -- and never filled, for four releases. So the check
  fell through to asking the client about **where you are standing**, which is
  precisely the guess the design replaced, and every self-flown estimate to
  another zone rested on it. It is now recorded on arrival, and flying
  somewhere is taken as proof that flying is allowed there.
- **A filter that follows you between tabs did not filter.** `/cn keepfilter`
  put the search term in the box and applied it to nothing on a tab's first
  visit, because the box was set before the tab's list existed. Its own help
  text warns that a filter you cannot see is how a list looks empty when it is
  not; what it produced was the same fault inverted -- a list that looks full
  when it is filtered. The function written to do this properly had never been
  called from anywhere.
- **A quest item is not an item the vendor will not buy.** The bag scan read
  `hasNoValue` -- "has no sell price" -- as though it meant "is a quest item",
  so every grey and every worthless token in your bags was flagged as one. The
  correct call was already being used forty lines away in the same file.
- **The refined preference counter kept the flat twenty-minute window** that
  0.46.0 replaced with per-type windows, so the two counters would have
  silently disagreed the moment a quest window was added.
- **One unguarded client call** in the provider file set whose entire purpose
  is that every client call goes through it, so that a patch break is a
  contained fix.
- **A second copy of a compatibility shim** was living outside the one file
  that gets audited for that class of mistake. There is one `CN.Unpack` again.
- **Eleven names in the static-analysis allowlist that the source no longer
  mentions.** An allowlist entry for something nothing calls weakens the only
  guarantee that file makes: that an undeclared global is a typo or a leak.
- **An infinite loop in the list widget, found by a new test.** It kept one
  piece of state on the frame while its neighbour had been moved off for the
  documented reason that reading an unset field on a frame is not guaranteed
  to give you nil. That is a fix applied to the instance somebody noticed
  rather than to the class, and the leftover hung the suite outright the first
  time a filter was set before any rows were.

## [0.46.0]

A release about speed, and about how this project keeps discovering that its
own test fixtures are smaller than the game. Three of the most expensive
things the addon does were invisible in every benchmark it has ever run,
because the fixtures behind them held three appearance sets, three bags of
items and three flight points. Measured at the size the game actually
produces, a cold rebuild cost **eleven and a half milliseconds** -- most of a
frame, on every event that invalidates the list.

It now costs **four**, with no answer changed.

### Changed

- **Costing a journey is twenty times cheaper.** The route search tries every
  pairing of flight points, deliberately -- the nearest one to you and the
  nearest one to your destination are frequently not the best route together.
  That is still exactly what it does. What it no longer does is recompute
  three distances inside every pairing: the walk at each end is measured once
  per flight point instead of once per pair, the flight legs between points
  are computed once per continent and kept until the list of points changes,
  and an origin whose walk alone already costs more than the best route found
  so far is abandoned without being examined. With a levelled character's
  sixty flight points on a continent, one estimate fell from **1.48 ms to
  0.04 ms**. Every objective that has a location pays this cost, so it
  multiplied by the whole candidate list.
- **Appearance sets are read once and kept until you collect one.** Scanning
  them was the single most expensive thing in the addon -- **4.4 ms**, more
  than every other source of recommendations added together -- and it ran on
  every rebuild. Collections change rarely and the client announces it when
  they do.
- **Your bags are read once and kept until they change.** Same shape, smaller
  number. The bank is deliberately kept separate: it is a different container
  list read at a different time, and serving one from the other's cache would
  report a bank you are not standing at.
- **How long the addon waits before deciding you took its advice** now depends
  on what the advice was. It was a flat twenty minutes for everything, which
  is roughly right for a quest and badly wrong at both ends: a dungeon takes
  most of an hour, and an appearance takes minutes. Reputation, renown and
  instances now get ninety minutes, achievements and professions an hour,
  appearances forty minutes.
- **The grouped help was rebuilt.** A test written this release counted what
  was actually in the "everything else" bucket: **74 of 123 commands**. The
  groups had been describing an addon three releases smaller than this one,
  and the catch-all had quietly become the main list -- which is the exact
  state the grouping was introduced to fix. Seven groups now, covering
  everything, and the build fails if more than two commands fall outside them.

### Added

- **`/cn urgency`** draws the deadline curve at ten distances from a reset, so
  the weighting that decides "this expires tonight" can be looked at rather
  than reasoned about. It has never been visible before.
- **The recording that the test suite audits itself against now carries the
  client version it was taken from**, and a recording older than the client
  the addon claims to support is a build failure rather than a quiet pass. An
  audit against a game that has since been patched is worse than no audit,
  because it reports success.
- **A missing recording is now a failure on a machine that has the game
  installed.** It stays a printed notice where no client exists, because the
  automated build has no game and never will -- but "unverified" had been
  printing for months while every run still ended in *all checks passed*.

### Fixed

- **The travel estimate's reported legs are the legs it costed.** The rewrite
  carries the walked distances internally as time and converts them back for
  display; a wrong conversion there would be invisible in the total and wrong
  on every screen showing the breakdown. There is now an assertion that the
  parts add up to the whole.
- **`NEW_TAXI_NODE` is not an event, and the addon was registering it.** The
  client refuses an event name it does not have -- it throws rather than
  ignoring -- so this produced a Lua error at every login, in a module that
  had been shipping the line for several releases. The name was plausible and
  invented. There is no discovery event; `TAXIMAP_OPENED` is the honest
  substitute, since you discover a flight point by talking to the flight
  master.
- **One bad event name is no longer a Lua error at every login.** Registration
  now goes through a guarded path: the client's refusal is caught, the name is
  kept, and `/cn errors` will name it. A feature that quietly does not update
  is a bad outcome; an error box on every login is a worse one.
- **Handlers registered before the event frame existed were reaching the
  client through an unguarded loop.** Most of the addon loads before
  `Events.lua`, so that replay -- not the registration itself -- is where a
  bad name from any earlier module actually reached the client. The guard now
  covers both.
- **The test suite could not see any of this, because the fake frame accepted
  any string.** Tenth entry in this project's list of defects caused by a stub
  simpler than the thing it stands for. The stub now refuses an event the
  client does not have, exactly as the client does, and the harness fails on
  anything the guarded path rejected -- production degrades, the build does
  not. The list of real event names is maintained by hand, which is precisely
  the fragile kind of artefact this keeps happening to, so `/cn capture` now
  asks the live client to register every event the addon uses and records what
  it refused. The audit fails on any refusal.
- **`fixtures\captured.lua` was being counted as addon source.** The recording
  is evidence, read only by the test harness, but it is a `.lua` file in the
  tree -- so `check` warned that it was missing from the `.toc` and `sync`
  would have listed it, handing the game a table of test data to load at
  login. Everything under `fixtures\` is now excluded by directory.
- **`check` said nothing when the tree was a release behind the toolkit.**
  There was a guard for a `cn.ps1` *older* than the source it manages, because
  that one would overwrite good source with old. The case that actually
  happens is the reverse: a new `cn.ps1` arrives, `init` declines to overwrite
  an existing tree, and every remaining line of the check reports contentedly
  on the previous release. It now fails, and names the command that fixes it.
- **A stale help entry named a command that does not exist.** Nothing errored
  -- the entry simply did not appear, and a command became undiscoverable
  while the help still looked complete. Every name in the help is now checked
  against the commands that are actually registered.

## [0.45.0]

Two promises this addon made in writing and did not keep, the last of the
backlog that can be built without a live client, and the first structural
split of the codebase.

### Fixed

- **Two features that existed only in a comment.** `Modules/Inventory.lua`
  opened, in 0.44.0, by saying the addon would tell you *"forty of the fifty
  things a quest wants, so the answer is ten more"* and would notice *"a
  recipe you already own and have not learned"*. It did neither: the file
  collected quest starters and stopped. Writing down what something is going
  to do and then not doing it is worse than not writing it down, because the
  next reader believes it. Both are built now, and the counting one is worth
  **more the closer it is** -- "one more feather" outranks a quest not begun.
- **`Inventory.bankIDs` had been declared and read by nothing** since the
  module was written -- a list of container numbers sitting there looking like
  a feature. The bank is scanned when you open one, remembered by item, and
  reported with its age, because the client will not describe a bank you are
  not standing at.

### Added

- **Appearance sets.** The addon has tracked individual appearances since
  0.13.0 without ever knowing the game groups them -- and collecting is
  overwhelmingly done by set. "Four of five pieces" is a real denominator,
  which this addon is normally short of. A finished set is not offered as
  nearly finished; a set barely begun is a decision, not a next action.
- **Your guild, and what you could queue for** -- read-only. The addon does
  not put you in a queue, and will not.
- **Flight paths are learned rather than assumed.** The costing has assumed
  since 0.42.0 that any flight point reaches any other on a continent. Mostly
  true; wrong often enough to matter. There is no API for "does A connect to
  B", so the addon watches the flights you take -- a flight taken is proof --
  and prefers a proven pair. A pair never flown is **not** ruled out: that
  would be worse than the assumption it replaces.
- **`/cn locale export`** prints a paste-ready block for a translator, rather
  than a list they would have to turn into Lua themselves.
- **Sortable lists** -- as ranked, alphabetical, reversed. "As ranked" is
  first, so the default never changes for anybody who does not go looking.
- **The window's filter can follow you between tabs** (`/cn keepfilter`), off
  by default, because a filter that persists invisibly is how a list looks
  empty when it is not.
- **Middle-click the minimap button** to start or stop follow mode.
- **Tooltips say where a collectible drops from**, which the addon has known
  since 0.41.0 without putting it where the mouse already is.
- **`cn.ps1 provenance`** -- how many quest rows are curated, how many were
  folded in from observed play, and how many were contributed. The
  distinction is preserved carefully at runtime and was invisible in the
  repository, where the decisions get made.
- **Sixteen more translated strings** across ten languages.

### Structure

- **`Providers/Blizzard.lua` split into three** at 2,250 lines --
  quests/reputation/character/map, collections, and the world -- divided by
  what the client is asked about, because that is how patches break things.
  `CN.Blizzard` is still one table.
- **The list widget moved out of `UI.lua`** into `UI/List.lua`. It is the
  piece with the least to do with the rest: it knows about rows, pooling,
  filtering and sorting, and nothing about what is in them.
- **`Modules/Navigation.lua` was deliberately NOT split.** Its four sections
  share half a dozen upvalues -- the target, the arrow, the smoothing state,
  the calibration counters -- so separating them is a real refactor rather
  than a move. It is also the one subsystem carrying a fix that has not yet
  been confirmed in game. Splitting it now would mean that if the arrow is
  still wrong, nobody could tell which change did it.

### Tooling

- **Twenty-three mutations, up from eighteen.** The five new ones found one
  hole, now closed.
- **A test that had quietly become two assertions in one.** "Appearance
  candidates are capped" counted objectives BY TYPE across the whole list, so
  the moment a second provider began emitting appearances it was asserting
  something about two unrelated caps added together. It counts its own
  provider now.
- **The curated data accessors have tests at last.** Class, race, faction,
  level and turn-in shipped as schema in 0.43.0 with no rows and nothing
  exercising the readers -- a schema nothing reads is a schema that is wrong
  the first time somebody fills it in.

### Notes

- An unknown quest is eligible. Absence of curated data is not a block, and
  never becomes one.

## [0.44.0]

The addon can see your bags, your mailbox and your keystone; it can cost a
journey to another continent; and it can tell you why the list is in the order
it is in. Two more defects found by the tooling built in 0.43.1.

### Fixed

- **Every flying speed sample was being thrown away.** 0.43.0 added a third
  speed bucket for flying yourself and left the sanity band alone -- a single
  range written when both buckets were ground travel, rejecting anything above
  60 yards per second. That is *below* the speed you actually fly at, so every
  genuine sample was discarded as implausible, the bucket never filled, and
  the flying estimate would have stayed seeded forever while appearing to
  work. The band is per bucket now. Found by a test that assumed a realistic
  flying speed.
- **Quest starters you had already used were recommended again.** The client
  flags an item as starting a quest whether or not you have accepted it.
- **The session planner laid out routes you could not start** -- the ranking
  knew you were dead or in a dungeon since 0.43.0 and the planner did not.

### Added

- **It looks in your bags.** `C_Container` appeared nowhere in this addon for
  twenty-nine releases, and a surprising amount of "what should I do next?"
  is already in there: the item that starts a quest, sitting since a boss
  dropped it, and mounts, pets and toys you own and have not learned. They
  cost **zero** travel, which is the honest number. `/cn bags`.
- **Things with a clock on them** -- `/cn clock`. Mail about to expire *with
  something attached* (expired mail is destroyed, not returned), the keystone
  that is replaced at the reset whether you use it or not, weekly profession
  knowledge that does not come back, and heirlooms.
- **Another continent is now costable.** Where a teleport you know lands on
  the right continent, the journey is priced: the teleport, the cooldown you
  would wait through, and the ordinary journey from where it drops you.
  Destinations are curated, because the client will not convert a bind
  location into a map.
- **`/cn nearby`** -- what is worth doing outside this zone, ordered by how
  long it takes to get there rather than how far away it is. The router has
  been zone-scoped since it was written; the distance function stopped being
  zone-scoped in 0.42.0 and nobody told the router.
- **`/cn order`** -- why the list is in this order. Every term in the score for
  the top few, biggest first, summing to the number shown. `/cn why` explains
  one objective; this explains the ranking.
- **Flying is remembered per zone.** `IsFlyableArea` answers for where you are
  standing and nothing answers for where you are going, so the addon records
  what it observes and trusts that over the near end.
- **`/cn help` is no longer 120 lines.** A dozen essentials by default,
  `/cn help all` grouped by what you are trying to do, and `/cn help <word>`
  searches names and descriptions.
- **The chase estimate walks its legs nearest-first** rather than in whatever
  order the steps happened to be listed.
- **The arrow's distance figure is eased**, like its rotation, and snaps on a
  real jump.
- **Errors survive a logout.** One summary line each, shown once and then
  forgotten -- because the case that mattered was somebody relogging before
  they thought to look.

### Tooling

- **A rule against constructs that mean two different things.** Seven of them,
  checked across every shipped file: two-argument `math.atan`, `table.unpack`,
  `math.fmod`, `goto`, `math.type`, `math.tointeger`, integer division. Each
  names what breaks and what to use instead. This is the generalisation of
  the 0.43.1 defect.
- **`CN.Mod` and `CN.Unpack`** join `CN.Atan2`: if a construct means two
  things, the addon uses neither directly.
- **An end-to-end session test** -- login, ask, explain, route, plan, follow,
  log out -- asserting that nothing throws in the order a player actually does
  things. Every part was tested; the sequence was not.
- **Eighteen mutations, up from ten.** The eight new ones found six holes in
  the suite on the day they were written; all six now have assertions. One of
  the eight was itself wrong -- `%` in Lua is already floored, so mutating to
  it changed nothing -- and was replaced with `math.fmod`, which is the real
  hazard.
- **Two more performance budgets**, and a zero measurement is now a FAILURE
  rather than a pass: "UI refresh: 0.000 ms" meant the function had returned
  immediately without running, which is a budget guarding nothing.
- **`bench.lua --history`** appends every measurement to a TSV. Budgets catch
  a cliff; they do not catch a slope, and the cold rebuild has crept from
  3.9ms to 6.2ms across eight releases without ever failing a gate.
- **Database version 7**, which enforces the remembered-quest-pin ceiling on
  read rather than trusting that it was never exceeded.

### Notes

- Nothing in this release uses, learns, moves, sends or opens anything. It
  reads your bags and your mailbox and tells you what is in them.

## [0.43.1]

One defect, found by evaluating the addon against the language the game
actually runs rather than the one its tests run on. It is the arrow bug that
has been reported three times.

### Fixed

- **Every bearing computed in game since 0.19.0 was wrong.** World of Warcraft
  runs Lua 5.1, in which `math.atan(y, x)` is the ONE-argument arctangent and
  the second argument is silently discarded. The offline test suite runs Lua
  5.4, where the same call is the two-argument form and is correct.

  ```
  Lua 5.4:  math.atan(1, 0) == 1.5707963   (90 degrees -- correct)
  Lua 5.1:  math.atan(1, 0) == 0.7853981   (45 degrees -- atan(1))
  ```

  No error, no warning, a plausible number. In game the arrow's bearing was
  `atan(dx)` with the north-south component of the direction thrown away,
  which is why it could never point behind the player -- reported three times
  as "it does not turn around when I walk past the destination", and "fixed"
  three times against a suite in which the code was genuinely correct.

  The same expression was also behind the motion-based facing calibration
  added in 0.40.0 and the minimap button's drag angle.

- **Overrides were invisible to anything that iterated settings.** The
  settings proxy exposed its merged view through the `__pairs` metamethod,
  which arrived in Lua 5.2. In 5.1 `pairs()` ignores it and yields nothing at
  all. `CN.AllSettings()` returns the merged table and works in both.

- **`/cn closest` threw for anybody whose database had been migrated.** 0.36.0
  stopped storing achievement points -- correctly, the client answers
  instantly -- and one of the three readers was missed. Points are read live
  now, and omitted rather than faked when the client will not say.

### Tooling

- **The test suite runs twice, on both languages**, locally and in CI, with
  Lua 5.1 first because it is the one that ships. This is the only mechanism
  that could have caught any of the three defects above.
- **A rule against the expression itself.** The suite walks every shipped file
  and fails if two-argument `math.atan` reappears. The fix is one function;
  the rule is what stops the next one.
- **The geometry tests run a second time under simulated 5.1 semantics**, so a
  reintroduction fails on the mathematics as well as on the grep.

### Notes

- This is the eighth defect in this project traced to the test environment
  differing from the real one, and the first where the difference was the
  language rather than something I stubbed. `/cn selftest` was built for
  exactly this class and could not catch it either: the check ran in game,
  where both the code and the check were using the same wrong function.

## [0.43.0]

The largest release this addon has had. Fifty-three items, and the short
version is: it knows how you actually travel, it knows what situation you are
in, it introduces itself, and its tests now check themselves.

### Fixed

- **Flying yourself was filed under "mounted".** The speed model has had two
  buckets since 0.31.0 -- mounted and on foot -- and skyriding landed in the
  first one beside a ground mount, dragging that median upward by however much
  you fly. That is the same mistake the file's own comment warns against, one
  level down. Three buckets now, and the third one changes the answer to
  almost every travel question.
- **The addon never noticed you were dead.** Recommending a battle pet to a
  corpse is the clearest possible signal that a tool is not watching. It now
  says so first, and ranks everything down until you are up.
- **A "quest three zones away" was structurally unanswerable.** The client only
  lists quest pins for the map you are looking at, which the addon recorded as
  a scope limit and left there. It now remembers every quest start it has ever
  seen, so `/cn waiting` can tell you what you walked past in Azj-Kahet last
  week.
- **World quests were still costed with a straight line and a flat penalty.**
  0.42.0 fixed that for ordinary quests and missed the provider where it
  matters most -- world quests are scattered across a continent and they
  expire.
- **Weekly deadlines were worth exactly nothing until their last two hours.**
  The urgency curve was built when everything with a deadline was a world
  quest. A raid lockout you are six bosses into, with a day left, could not
  outrank anything. There are two ramps now: a week-long one that breaks ties
  between things that are all days away, and the original steep one on top,
  which still dominates -- ten minutes beats four days, as it should.
- **Account-wide currencies were recommended on every character.** The client
  flags them; the addon ignored the flag. That is the exact mistake the
  Warband work exists to prevent, in the one store nobody had told about it.
- **The arrow stepped rather than swept.** It recomputes ten times a second and
  snapped to each new bearing. It eases now -- except through a reversal,
  which still snaps, because an arrow easing through 170 degrees is pointing
  at nothing at all for a quarter of a second.

### Added

- **Flying yourself, hearthstones and teleports.** A journey is now costed
  against three options -- run, take a flight path, or fly it yourself -- and
  the third usually wins in current content. Cross-continent still refuses to
  invent a duration, but it now lists what you actually have: every
  hearthstone and teleport you know, with the cooldown the client reports.
- **`/cn waiting`** -- quests you have seen and never picked up, by zone.
- **`/cn situation`** -- what the addon thinks you are in the middle of, and
  what that is changing about the ranking. In an instance with four other
  people, outside work ranks down.
- **`/cn orders`** -- crafting orders you placed, and anything finished and
  waiting. It does not open or scrape the order frame.
- **`/cn contribute`** -- shares the quest chains your play has taught the
  addon, as one line of quest IDs you can read before you send it. No server,
  no account, no personal data: the addon cannot upload anything, and this is
  a format you paste into an issue yourself. Imports land as observations,
  never as curated fact.
- **A first-run question.** One screen, four buttons, asked once, setting the
  focus mode that almost nobody discovered because `/cn mode collecting` is a
  sentence you have to already know to type.
- **Visible route progress.** Follow mode now says "stop 3 of 7 cleared" as you
  walk it, and marks the moment a route is actually finished. Sound and a
  flash are available and off by default.
- **`/cn hud`** -- a small always-on line showing the next thing. Off by
  default, like everything here that puts pixels on screen uninvited.
- **`/cn scale` and `/cn colourblind`.** The arrow's entire language was
  colour -- blue on course, amber drifting, red walking away -- which is
  precisely the design that fails a colourblind player. In that mode it
  carries the word as well.
- **A filter box in the window**, and the addon now appears in the game's own
  options list rather than only inside a window you have to know how to open.
- **Three more keybindings**: follow, plan, and the heads-up line.
- **`/cn errors`** -- failures inside the addon are caught so they cannot break
  your session, which is also why they were invisible. They are kept now, and
  a bug report can carry the text instead of a description of the text.
- **`/cn dbsize` reports memory as well as disk.** One of the two was being
  measured and the other assumed.
- **Curated gating data**: class, race, faction and level, plus turn-in
  locations, so `/cn why` can say "that one is for a Druid" rather than
  leaving the player to work out why they cannot see it.
- **Fifteen more translated strings**, across ten languages.
- **A standing Delves probe.** The decision not to build Delve tracking has
  been made twice, for a reason -- `C_DelvesUI` exposes interface plumbing and
  not progress -- and a decision nobody re-checks becomes a thing everyone
  forgot. The self-test now names the exact API that would change it.

### Tooling

- **`mutate.sh`** -- breaks the code on purpose, ten ways, and fails if the
  suite does not notice. It found three holes on the day it was written, all
  three now covered. This was being done by hand, from memory, which means
  inconsistently.
- **Performance budgets in CI.** Two regressions have shipped in this project
  and both were visible in the benchmark output at the time. Printing a number
  somebody has to remember is not a check.
- **Release notes are cut from the changelog** for the version being built,
  rather than the whole file since 0.1.0.
- **`cn.ps1 interface`** -- sets the game interface version and prints the rest
  of the patch checklist, which had been living in my head.
- **Issue templates** that ask for `/cn selftest` and `/cn errors` output.
- **The translation lint now checks both directions.** It caught orphaned
  translations; the failure that actually happens is the reverse -- the key IS
  the English string, so editing the English silently orphans every
  translation of it.
- **Coverage floor raised to 83%**, and the Wago publishing field prepared.

### Notes

- A surviving mutation is a hole in the test suite, not a mutation to delete.
- The filter box keeps its state in a local rather than on the frame. Reading
  an unset field off a frame does not reliably return nil -- a metatable can
  answer -- and the first version relied on it. The harness caught that; a
  player running a UI replacement might have found it instead.

## [0.42.0]

Travel that knows about flight paths, an honest answer to "how long will this
take", and prerequisite chains that finally reach the shipped data.

### Fixed

- **Every travel figure in the addon was a straight line.** Within a zone that
  is very nearly right. Between zones it was not even approximately right, and
  the addon covered that with a flat penalty: anything outside your current
  zone cost the same whether it was over the next ridge or on the far side of
  the continent. A journey is now costed the way you would actually make it --
  run to the nearest flight point **you have discovered**, fly, run from the
  arrival point -- against simply running the whole way, whichever is quicker.
  This is why `/cn plan 30` could put a nine-minute flight into your half hour.
- **Flight speed was not merely unknown, it was thrown away.** The addon has
  measured your running speed for several releases and explicitly discarded
  taxi movement while doing it. It now measures your flying speed too, from
  your own flights, and says *estimated* until it has. The client does not
  expose the number and it differs between expansions, so measuring is the
  only honest way to have it.
- **Harvested prerequisites could never reach `Data/Quests.lua`.** The addon
  wrote them, the toolkit's parser could not see an array field at all, and so
  it silently dropped every chain -- both halves looking like they worked. The
  parser reads them now, `cn.ps1 harvest` writes them, and a row that already
  exists for its location gains its chain rather than being skipped whole. A
  `requires` that is already there is never overwritten: curated data outranks
  observation, so this is an insert, not an update.
- **Two maps meant no distance at all.** Cross-map distances are now computed
  in world coordinates, which are continuous across a continent, instead of in
  map coordinates, which are normalised per map and cannot be compared.

### Added

- **`/cn chase` now says how long the goal will take.** The addon already
  measured how long each kind of objective takes *you* and how long it takes
  to get anywhere; nothing multiplied them. It is a **range**, not a figure,
  because task times vary by more than a third with competition, group size
  and luck -- and where more than half the steps are kinds of thing it has
  never watched you do, it says *time unknown* and how many, rather than
  averaging its way to a number that looks like a fact.
- **`/cn travel`** -- how long it takes to reach the top recommendation and by
  what route: how far to the flight point, how far in the air, how far at the
  far end, and what running the whole way would have cost. Also how many
  flight points you know and whether your flying speed has been measured yet.

### Notes

- Two continents with no flight between them return **nothing**, not a large
  number. Portals and boats are not modelled, and a fabricated four hours
  would be worse than an admission.
- Flight points you have not discovered do not exist as far as the costing is
  concerned, because they do not exist for you either. A pessimistic plan you
  can follow beats an optimistic one you cannot.
- The one invented constant in the travel model is the twenty seconds a flight
  costs before it starts moving -- talking to the flight master, mounting, and
  landing. It is a constant rather than a measurement because timing it would
  mostly be timing how fast you read a gossip window.

## [0.41.0]

The addon can see inside a dungeon, it learns what you actually do, and its
tests can finally check themselves against a real client.

### Added

- **Dungeons and raids.** Until now this addon knew everything about the open
  world and nothing about the inside of an instance: a mount that drops from a
  raid boss was a line of free text with no boss, no instance, and no idea
  whether you had already killed the thing this week. Now:
  - **`/cn instances`** -- what you are saved to, how much of each is left, and
    when it resets. Where nothing has been killed yet, every boss is named;
    part-way through, the client reports how many are left rather than which,
    and so does this, because inventing the names would be inventing
    information.
  - **`/cn drops <name>`** -- which boss drops something, in which instance,
    and whether your own lockout is in the way.
  - **`/cn chase` on an instance drop now names the boss** instead of
    dead-ending in prose, and marks the step blocked with a reset time when
    you are already saved and cleared.
  - **A part-finished lockout now competes for "what next".** Those kills are
    spent effort with an expiry on them, which makes them some of the cheapest
    progress in the game -- and the ranking could not see them at all.
    A lockout you have not started is deliberately *not* recommended: that is
    a decision about your evening, not a next action.
  - Reading the Adventure Guide **changes what it is displaying**, so the addon
    refuses to read it at all while you have it open, and puts its selection
    back exactly as it found it when you do not.
- **It learns which kinds of thing you actually go and do.** `/cn learned`
  shows the whole table. The guardrails matter more than the learning: nothing
  moves until a type has been shown 25 times, the adjustment is clamped to a
  narrow band so a type you ignore gets quieter but never silent, every
  adjusted line says on the line that it was adjusted, the counters decay so
  the addon tracks how you play now, `/cn learned reset` throws it all away,
  and `/cn learned off` switches it off entirely. A focus you chose with
  `/cn mode` always outranks a habit the addon inferred.
- **`/cn capture` and `cn.ps1 fixtures`.** Nine defects in this addon's history
  came from the offline test suite modelling the world more simply than the
  world is -- most recently by treating every map in the game as a perfect
  square, which hid an angle error in every zone for eight releases. Writing
  more careful stubs does not fix that, because the author of a stub does not
  know which part of reality he simplified. So the addon can now record what
  your client actually returned, and the test suite audits its own stubs
  against that recording: a stub missing a field reality had is a test failure
  rather than a future bug report. Shapes and counts only -- nothing that
  identifies you, and nothing leaves your machine.

### Fixed

- **Switching a setting off wrote nothing.** `x and false or nil` cannot
  produce false in Lua -- `and false` is falsy, so it falls through to the
  `or` every time. The line read correctly and did nothing. Caught by a test
  that asserted the switch worked rather than that it had been called.
- **A completion the client identifies differently was never credited.**
  `NEW_PET_ADDED` reports the pet you now own, not the species that was
  recommended. Those now match by type; quests and achievements, whose events
  carry exactly the id that was recommended, deliberately do not, because a
  loose match there would credit the addon for every quest anybody turns in.

### Notes

- `/cn selftest` is now fifteen checks: the two new ones read your lockouts
  and confirm the Adventure Guide can be read without disturbing what you are
  looking at. With it open, that check SKIPs and says the refusal was the
  intended behaviour rather than a fault.
- One assertion in the suite asserted "a pinned goal ranks in the top three",
  which was a magic number meaning "above the three expiring things this
  fixture happens to contain". It broke when a provider was added, for a
  reason that had nothing to do with goals. It now asserts the property that
  was actually meant: only time-limited work may outrank a pinned goal.
- The multiplier the learning applies is memoised. Uncached, it resolved the
  settings proxy once per candidate and doubled the cost of building the list.

## [0.40.0]

Two things the arrow was doing wrong in every zone, and the addon finally
speaks more than one language.

### Fixed

- **Every bearing the arrow computed was stretched by the shape of the zone.**
  Map coordinates run 0 to 1 across a map regardless of the ground underneath,
  so a zone twice as wide as it is tall compresses east-west angles by half.
  The arrow measured its angles in those raw coordinates, which means a target
  genuinely 45 degrees off your left read as something else entirely --
  in every zone in the game, on every target, since the arrow was written.
  Bearings are now measured in yards, using the size the client reports for
  the map you are standing in. Distances were always correct; angles now are
  too.
- **Which way the client counts your facing is now settled by watching you
  move.** Whether `GetPlayerFacing` grows as you turn left or as you turn
  right is a client convention that cannot be derived, and getting it wrong
  does not make the arrow point backwards -- it makes it *mirrored*, wrong by
  twice your facing, which looks correct when you face north and badly wrong
  when you face east. The old evidence for it was indirect and only arrived
  when you happened to be lined up with a target and walking. The new evidence
  is direct: when you move, the direction you moved is the direction you were
  facing, and only one of the two conventions agrees with that. Strafing and
  walking backwards agree with neither and are discarded rather than voted on,
  and six consecutive samples are required, so nothing a knockback or a lag
  spike does can flip your arrow.

### Added

- **`/cn selftest`** -- thirteen checks that run against your live client and
  report what they actually found: whether your position converts, whether the
  arrow's facing has been confirmed against your own movement, whether the map
  reports quests you have not accepted, whether achievement criteria carry
  their counters, how large your saved data is, and whether the engine can
  answer "what next" at all. Each check exists because something it covers was
  once broken in a shipped release and was found by somebody playing rather
  than by the test suite. A check that cannot be answered says so and skips;
  it does not pass.
- **Translation support, with nine languages started.** German, Spanish
  (Spain and Mexico), French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and both
  Chinese scripts. The framework covers the whole addon; the bundled
  translations cover the strings you see most, and anything not yet translated
  falls back to English rather than to a blank label. `/cn locale` says how
  far along your language is, and `/cn locale missing` prints exactly the list
  a translator would work from. Nothing was machine-translated to make that
  number look better.

### Notes

- The self-test's bearing check was written the obvious way first: project a
  point in front of the player using the addon's own facing convention, then
  ask the addon which way that point is. It passed, and it would have passed
  with the maths inverted, because it derived its expected answer from the
  code it was checking. It was rewritten against cases whose answers come from
  the definition of a map, and the suite now breaks the maths deliberately and
  requires the check to notice.
- The offline test suite modelled every map as a flat 1,000 by 1,000 yard
  square for eight releases, which is why the angle error above survived every
  test the addon has. The stub now describes maps that are not square, and one
  of the new checks reports the real shape of the zone you are standing in.

## [0.39.0]

An addon that knows nothing should say so more than once.

### Fixed

- **The first-run prompt fired once, ever.** A fresh install has scanned
  nothing, so it knows nothing about your collections and its
  recommendations are correspondingly thin. It said so -- one line, eight
  seconds after your first login, in the middle of the login chatter -- and
  then recorded that it had spoken and never mentioned it again.
  Miss that line, which most people would, and the addon underperforms
  silently for the rest of its installed life with no way to find out why.
  It now says so every login **until the scan has actually been run**, and
  then never again. That is the difference between a reminder and nagging: a
  reminder stops when the thing is finished.
- **Two subsystems can only be read while their window is open**, so the addon
  can be fully set up and still blind to a profession you levelled last week.
  It knew that, and only said so immediately after a manual scan -- the one
  moment you are least likely to need telling. It is now mentioned at login,
  at most once a week, because the fix is "open a window some time" rather
  than anything urgent.

### Added

- **`/cn setup check`** -- what the addon still cannot see, without
  rescanning anything. "What can you not see?" and "go and look again" are
  different questions, and answering the first by doing the second is why
  people stop asking.

### Notes

- The existing behaviour was **prompt, never act** -- eleven scans run
  uninvited on someone's login is the same discourtesy as seizing their
  waypoint. That stance is unchanged and correct; the defect was that the
  prompt gave up after one attempt at being heard.
- **The navigation arrow is untouched for the fifth release running**, for the
  same reason each time: two fixes to it are shipped and unverified, and
  `/cn navdiag` will settle it in one command.

## [0.38.0]

The hottest path in the addon was the slowest thing in it.

### Fixed

- **Every item tooltip scanned every recipe you know.** To answer "is this
  item a recipe?", the tooltip walked the entire recipe list -- lowercasing
  each name and searching it -- because the item that *teaches* a recipe is
  named after the recipe rather than sharing its ID.
  At retail scale that is twenty-five hundred iterations and five thousand
  string allocations, to answer a question about one item. **Measured at
  0.536ms per tooltip** -- three per cent of a frame for hovering one thing,
  and sweeping a bag or an auction house list fires dozens of them a second.
  A lowercased name index, built once and rebuilt only when recipes are
  scanned, answers the same question with two hash lookups. **0.536ms to
  0.004ms**, a hundred and thirty-fold.
- The old match used a substring search, which could recognise an item as a
  recipe far more loosely than intended -- any item whose name happened to
  contain a recipe's name anywhere. The replacement matches the name exactly,
  or the name with a known teaching prefix removed (`Recipe:`, `Pattern:`,
  `Plans:` and the rest). More correct as well as faster, and there is a test
  asserting an unrelated item is not mistaken for a recipe.

### Notes

- Two tests in this release had to be rewritten before they could fail.
  The invalidation test bumped the index's revision by hand, which proved the
  index respects a revision but said nothing about whether anything ever
  changes one -- deleting the scanner's bump left it passing while the tooltip
  would have answered from a stale index for the rest of the session. It now
  drives a real scan.
  This keeps happening in the same shape: a test that exercises the mechanism
  instead of the caller. Worth naming as its own rule alongside the one about
  stubs -- **assert through the path the game actually takes, not the seam you
  built to make it testable.**
- **The navigation arrow is untouched for the fourth release running.** Two
  fixes to it are shipped and unverified; `/cn navdiag` settles it in one
  command when there is time.

## [0.37.0]

The window itself. Two defects that only show up while you are looking at it.

### Fixed

- **Every list redraw allocated three closures per row.** The click and hover
  handlers were built inside the redraw, so a hundred-row list threw away and
  rebuilt three hundred functions every time the window refreshed -- each one
  capturing a table it did not need to capture.
  In this game that is not an abstract cost. Allocation churn is what garbage
  collection pauses are made of, and a pause is a stutter. The handlers are
  now bound once when a row is created and read the row's current entry, so a
  redraw allocates nothing at all.
- **The row pool had no ceiling.** Frames cannot be destroyed in this game,
  only hidden and reused, so a list that renders one frame per entry grows to
  the size of the largest list it has ever shown and keeps it for the rest of
  the session. A thousand entries meant a thousand permanent frames.
  Capped, and when the cap bites the list says **"... and N more not shown"**
  rather than simply ending. A truncated list that looks complete is worse
  than a long one.

### Notes

- Binding a handler once is only correct if it reads the row's *current*
  entry rather than the one that was there when it was bound -- otherwise
  clicking the first row would forever run the first list's action. That is
  asserted directly: the list is refilled with different actions and the
  handler must run the new one.
- The first version of the row-cap test compared both sides of the assertion
  to the setting it was meant to constrain, so raising the cap moved the
  goalposts and the test passed against a list that created a thousand
  frames. It now asserts an absolute number. A ceiling defined by the thing it
  constrains is not a ceiling -- and this is the same shape of mistake as the
  fixture that was ordered like the bug in 0.31.0.
- **The navigation arrow is untouched for the third release running**, for the
  same reason: two fixes to it are shipped and unverified, and `/cn navdiag`
  will settle it in one command.

## [0.36.0]

Finishing what 0.35.0 measured.

### Changed

- **Saved data: 947 KB down to 832 KB**, and 1,275 KB down to 832 KB across
  the two releases -- a third less written on every logout and parsed on every
  login.
  Achievements kept a name and a point value for every tracked row; pets kept
  a name for all eighteen hundred. Every one of those comes back from the
  client in microseconds. Names now resolve live, from the achievement info
  and the pet journal, and databases written before this release still honour
  whatever name they are carrying until the migration clears it.
- **Per-row timestamps are gone.** Achievements, pets, toys and recipes each
  stamped `firstSeen` and `lastSeen` on every row. Nothing read them. Roughly
  seven thousand rows carried a pair of values that existed only to be written
  to disk and parsed back. (The per-character `lastSeen` is a different thing
  and stays -- `/cn alts` needs it to say how old its information is.)
- The migration reclaims all of it on the next login rather than on the next
  full rescan.

### Notes

- These were named in the 0.35.0 roadmap with their measurements, and pets
  were deliberately deferred there because the name had six consumers
  including a search. Doing it in its own release, with a resolver and tests
  rather than at the end of an unrelated one, is why it took two versions
  instead of one.
- The benchmark fixture had to be corrected first -- twice now. It was writing
  the *old* shape, so it would have reported a saving that had not happened.
  A performance measurement taken against a fixture that does not match what
  the code writes is a measurement of nothing, and this is the second release
  running where checking that came before believing the number.
  The timestamp removal is real but does **not** appear in the 832 KB figure,
  because the fixture never modelled the timestamps in the first place. Said
  plainly rather than folded into a larger claim.
- **The navigation arrow is untouched again.** Two fixes to it remain
  unverified; `/cn navdiag` will answer it in one command when there is time
  to look.

## [0.35.0]

A third of what this addon saved to disk was a copy of something the game
already had.

### Changed

- **Saved data: 1,275 KB down to 947 KB**, measured at retail scale. The
  client rewrites this file in full on every logout and parses it again on
  every login, so it is a cost paid twice a session, and nobody had ever
  measured it.
  The largest contributor was **vendors, at 488 KB for twenty of them** --
  roughly twenty-four kilobytes each. Every vendor stored the *name* of every
  item it sold, which is a duplicate of the client's own item cache, plus a
  table per item to hold two fields. Names are gone and prices are stored as
  bare numbers; a three-hundred-item merchant now costs 6 KB instead of over
  twenty. Prices are still kept, because the client only reports them while
  the merchant window is open and they genuinely cannot be recovered later.
- **A migration reclaims it on the next login** rather than waiting for you to
  reopen every merchant you have ever visited.

### Added

- **`/cn dbsize`** -- how much the addon writes to disk and where it goes, so
  this cannot quietly grow back.
- The test suite asserts a three-hundred-item vendor stays in single-figure
  kilobytes, and that the migration actually drops names already on disk.

### Notes

- The rule this establishes, worth stating because it will apply again:
  **persist only what the client cannot tell us.** Names, collected states and
  completion flags come back instantly from the game. Cross-character
  knowledge, observations gathered over time, and the player's own choices do
  not -- and those are what this database is actually for.
- Two further stores fit the same argument: achievements at 394 KB and pets at
  274 KB, both carrying names the client can re-supply. Pets were deliberately
  left alone here -- the name has six consumers including a search, and a
  six-site refactor rushed at the end of a release is how a saving becomes a
  regression. Both are written up in the roadmap with their measurements.
- **Nothing was changed in the navigation arrow this release.** Two fixes to
  it are shipped and unverified, and stacking a third speculative change on
  top of them would make the next report harder to interpret, not easier.

## [0.34.0]

The arrow stopped working indoors, and now it can explain itself.

### Fixed

- **Stepping into a building, a cave or a city district stopped the arrow.**
  The client answers "which map are you on" with the most *specific* map
  containing you, so walking through a door changes it -- while you have moved
  thirty yards. The arrow compared that to the destination's map, found them
  different, and announced "another zone" while standing next to the thing it
  was pointing at.
  It now asks the client where you are **as expressed on the destination's
  map**, which works for any map that can describe you, and only gives up when
  the answer is genuinely nowhere -- another continent, or an instance. That
  case still says so plainly rather than producing a confident arrow pointing
  at nothing.
  This is the same defect that made available quests invisible in a city in
  0.27.0, in a different file, with the same cause: assuming the map under
  your feet is the map the data is on.

### Added

- **`/cn navdiag` -- everything the arrow is thinking, in one command.**
  Written because the arrow has been reported as misbehaving twice, and both
  times the only available evidence was a description in prose. I guessed from
  it twice and was wrong twice. Prose is a bad instrument.
  It reports what is being tracked, where the client says you are, which way it
  says you are facing, every intermediate value in the bearing, the rotation
  actually applied to the texture, the colour that implies, and -- crucially --
  which of the several things that can silently change your destination is
  switched on. If the arrow does something surprising again, one command
  produces the answer instead of a conversation.

### Notes

- The offline stub answered "where is the player on this map?" for *every*
  map, including ones on other continents. That made "you are in a building
  inside this zone" and "you are on another continent" indistinguishable --
  two cases that need opposite behaviour from the arrow. The stub now refuses
  maps that cannot place the player, which is what the client does.
  Seventh instance of the same pattern, and the rule written down in 0.33.0
  is what caught this one: ask which part of reality the stub is refusing to
  model, and whether that is the part under test.
- One test in this release had to be corrected rather than the code: it put
  the player on a map the client could not place them on, which is a state the
  client never produces. A test asserting behaviour in an impossible state
  proves nothing about a real one.

## [0.33.0]

The arrow. Reported twice, and I did not find it either time because I never
wrote the test that would have shown it.

### Fixed

- **Arriving re-pointed the arrow at a different destination without saying
  so.** This is the actual defect behind *"I walked past it and the arrow did
  not turn around."* With auto-advance on, reaching a destination hands the
  arrow to the next thing on the route -- and the arrow looks absolutely
  identical doing it. Same shape, same blue, still ahead of you, distance now
  counting **up** because the new destination is further away than the one you
  just walked through.
  A player seeing that concludes the arrow failed to turn round, and they are
  not wrong to: nothing on screen said the destination had changed. The addon
  now names the new destination in chat and the arrow's own label updates to
  match. The maths was never wrong; the communication was.
- **Hiding the arrow left everything it was showing intact.** Rotation, colour
  and distance were never reset, so an arrow hidden while pointing north-east
  at "10 yd" was still pointing north-east at "10 yd" the instant anything
  showed it again -- a stale claim about a destination nobody was tracking.
- **Arrival latched permanently.** `arrived` was set once and never cleared,
  so walking back out of range left the addon believing you were still there.
  Defensive rather than load-bearing -- the arrow turned round correctly even
  with the latch in place, and I am saying so rather than claiming a fix I did
  not need to make -- but a flag that can only ever be set once is a bug
  waiting for a caller.

### Added

- **The arrow is testable for the first time.** The offline harness's texture
  stub accepted `SetRotation` and `SetVertexColor` and remembered neither, and
  its font strings swallowed `SetText`. The single most visible thing this
  addon draws had no test that could see which way it pointed or what colour
  it was. Both now record, and so does the player's position -- which was a
  fixed point, meaning every arrow test ever written tested standing still.
- A walk-past test drives the real refresh path: approach, arrive, continue,
  and assert the arrow turns a half circle, recolours, keeps reporting a real
  distance, announces a re-target, and leaves nothing stale behind.

### Notes

- Six times now a stub has modelled the world more simply than the world and
  hidden a defect: a flat map point, a quest list without quest starts, an
  achievement criterion without a counter, a completed-quest list that cost
  nothing to read, a fixture ordered the same way as the bug, and now a player
  who could not move and an arrow whose direction nobody could read.
  The pattern is exact enough to state as a rule: **when a test needs a stub,
  the first question is which part of reality the stub is refusing to model,
  and the second is whether that is the part under test.**

## [0.32.0]

The quest counter was costing your entire quest history to display.

### Fixed

- **Reading "quests completed" allocated a copy of every quest you have ever
  finished.** `C_QuestLog.GetAllCompletedQuestIDs` does not return a number;
  it builds a table containing all of them -- tens of thousands of entries for
  anyone who has played a while, which is exactly who this addon is for. The
  Journey tab called it on every refresh to display one integer.
  It is now read once and kept, so twenty-five refreshes cost one trip to the
  client instead of twenty-five. Measured at a realistic twelve thousand
  completed quests: **0.260ms per refresh, now 0.000ms.**
- **The offline test stub was hiding it.** It handed back the same table on
  every call, so reading the history looked free and the cost was invisible to
  every test that had ever run. The stub now builds a fresh table, because
  that is what the client does.
  This is the fifth time in this project a stub has modelled the world more
  cheaply than the world and hidden a real defect. The pattern is always the
  same: a stub that costs less than the thing it stands for.

### Notes

- **I nearly shipped a cache that did not cache.** The obvious invalidation
  list includes `QUEST_LOG_UPDATE`, which sounds right and fires many times a
  second during normal play -- so hooking it handed the entire saving straight
  back. The benchmark caught it: 0.000ms became 0.244ms, which is to say
  exactly the number I had just removed.
  Invalidation is now precise on the events that certainly change the count,
  with a sixty-second staleness bound for anything that slips through. A count
  a minute out of date is not a problem; a count that costs a quest history to
  display is.
  Both behaviours are asserted, including the negative one -- hooking the
  chatty event fails the build.

## [0.31.0]

Which zone next -- and two bugs that were hiding the answer.

### Added

- **`/cn zones` -- which zone to work on next, and why.** The addon could
  answer *what next* and *where in this zone*, and had nothing at all to say
  about *which zone*. That is the question somebody working through a
  continent asks every time they finish one.
  Zones are ranked by what is cheapest to finish rather than by size: a zone
  you are most of the way through beats a fresh one, a fresh small zone beats
  a fresh enormous one, the zone you are standing in costs nothing to reach,
  and anything you have pinned as a goal is lifted. Every line says which of
  those reasons applied.

### Fixed

- **A zone you had never set foot in could never be recommended.** The
  underlying list excluded anything with zero progress. For a player sweeping
  a continent -- the exact person this is for -- the untouched zones are the
  entire point. They are now included and ranked separately, because "you are
  90% through this one" and "you have not started this one" are different
  suggestions and blending them by percentage buries every fresh zone under
  every half-finished one forever.
- **The zone ordering was being thrown away.** The list was sorted carefully
  by completion, then handed to a helper that re-sorts by a field these rows
  do not carry -- so every row compared equal, the tie-break took over, and
  the whole list silently collapsed to alphabetical by achievement ID. It only
  bit when there were more zones than the display limit, which is to say:
  always, on a real account.

### Notes

- Both bugs sat in eleven lines of code that had passed every release since
  they were written, because nothing had ever asked the function for fewer
  rows than it had.
- Two tests in this release had to be corrected rather than the code.
  The first demanded that a zone you are chasing outrank everything -- but a
  zone with one quest left genuinely does beat a ninety-quest zone you have
  merely pinned, and rewriting the scoring to satisfy the assertion would have
  made the addon worse to make a line green. The second numbered its fixtures
  in the correct order, so the broken ordering and the right one produced the
  same list and the test passed against the bug; the IDs now run deliberately
  backwards. That is the fourth time in this project a test has agreed with a
  defect, and every one has been the same mistake: a fixture that cannot tell
  the two answers apart.

## [0.30.0]

The rest of your Warband, and two things that were quietly throwing work away.

### Added

- **`/cn alts` -- should you be playing somebody else?** The addon has known
  the answer for several releases and had no way to volunteer it. It could
  tell you which character was best for one objective, when asked, buried in
  `/cn why`. The question a player actually has runs the other way: *is the
  character I am logged into the right one for tonight?*
  It now looks at what is on your list, asks the Warband who each thing
  belongs to, groups the answers by character, and says either "this one is
  fine" or "your Druid could do four of these".
- **It refuses to suggest a switch for account-wide progress**, which is the
  one answer that would actively waste your time -- a loading screen to earn
  something that would have counted anyway. There is a test for exactly that,
  because it is the mistake this feature exists to avoid making.
- **It says how old its information is.** Everything known about another
  character is whatever that character recorded the last time it logged in. A
  roster line reads "yesterday" or "3 weeks ago", and anything past a month
  stops producing suggestions rather than presenting a stale snapshot as
  current.
- The verdict is deliberately conservative: one reason is not enough to
  recommend a loading screen. A tool that suggests switching every time you
  log in is a tool people turn off.

### Fixed

- **Follow mode moved your waypoint mid-fight.** Clearing the last objective
  at a camp while something is hitting you caused the arrow and the waypoint
  to swing to the next stop -- the single most intrusive moment the addon
  could have chosen. Automatic advances now wait for the fight to end and then
  happen immediately. Pressing the button yourself still works during combat;
  you can see your own screen.
- **Measured travel speed was thrown away on every reload.** The samples lived
  in a table that died with the session, so a `/reload` -- which a player does
  several times an hour -- put the planner back on a guessed constant. The
  addon was permanently five samples away from being useful and never got
  there. Samples are now kept per character and survive reloading, logging
  out, and patch days.
- Corrupt values in the saved samples are cleaned on load rather than filtered
  on every read. SavedVariables outlive every version of this addon; junk left
  in place is junk filtered forever.

## [0.29.0]

No new features. Six defects, four of them mine, and the rebuild cut by two
thirds.

### Fixed

- **The urgency curve barely fired.** 0.28.0 shipped a headline feature that
  weights anything carrying a deadline, and then only two providers attached
  one. A daily disappears at the daily reset, a timed quest carries its own
  clock, and a capped currency wastes everything you earn until the weekly
  reset -- all knowable, none of them being said. Now they are.
  Worth stating plainly: the release notes for 0.28.0 described a feature
  that was, in practice, close to inert.
- **Durations were measured with a one-second ruler.** `time()` returns whole
  seconds, so a ten-second travel sample carried up to ten per cent of error,
  and anything finished inside the same second it was offered read as zero
  elapsed and was discarded as implausible -- which threw away precisely the
  fast turn-ins a quest grinder produces most of. Measurement now uses the
  client's fractional clock.
- **Travel speed was one median across mounted and unmounted travel** -- a
  number wrong in both states. Two buckets now, with samples that span
  mounting discarded as belonging to neither.
- **The offer table grew without bound.** Every objective the addon decorated
  got a timestamp and only completing it removed one; crossing a dozen zones
  accumulated an entry for everything that ever scrolled past. Entries now
  expire and the table is capped.
- **Duration timing ran on every candidate rather than every recommendation.**
  Two hundred timestamps taken per rebuild at retail scale, of which the
  player saw perhaps five. Wrong on cost and wrong on meaning -- something
  ranked one hundred and eightieth has not been offered to anybody.
- **"Available to pick up here" could mean a four-minute ride away.** Widening
  the search to neighbouring maps is what fixed a player being told zero while
  standing in front of a quest giver; it also made "here" overstate the case.
  Results are now split by real distance, and the wording matches which.

### Changed

- **A cold rebuild costs 5.5ms instead of 15.6ms** at retail scale (1800 pets,
  3000 achievements, 2500 recipes), measured, not estimated.
  Two providers accounted for most of it and both were doing the same thing
  wrong. Achievements walked all three thousand rows on every rebuild to keep
  about a dozen, rejecting the same two thousand nine hundred and eighty every
  time; it now keeps a shortlist against a revision number and costs 0.02ms.
  Reputations built a complete objective -- table, reasons, formatted strings
  -- for all five hundred factions and then discarded all but sixty; it now
  scores first and allocates only the survivors.

### Added

- **The release now refuses to proceed until the project page has been
  reviewed against it.** A release with no user-visible change legitimately
  needs no new copy -- but that has to be a decision somebody made, and this
  time it was an omission the author had to catch. `_curseforge/REVIEWED.txt`
  carries the version the page was last considered against, and `check` fails
  until it matches the tree. Editing the description satisfies it; deciding no
  edit is needed means bumping the marker, which is a five-second
  acknowledgement that the question was asked.
  "How fast it is" and "how accurate it is" count as things a player notices.
  That is written into the failure message, because the judgement that got
  this wrong was mine.

- **`cn.ps1 ci` replaces the standalone CI script, and explains its own
  failures.** Checking a build twice per invocation against an unauthenticated
  budget of sixty requests an hour means roughly thirty checks -- which
  somebody watching a release will spend in ten minutes, after which every
  call returns a bare `403 Forbidden` that says nothing about why.
  It now reads the rate-limit headers and says which limit was hit and when it
  clears, caches answers for twenty-five seconds so pressing it again costs
  nothing, accepts a token for a budget of five thousand, and offers
  `ci -Watch` to follow a run to completion on one invocation instead of being
  re-run by hand. The repository is read from the git remote, so a fork
  reports its own builds rather than the upstream's.

### Notes

- The urgency test took three attempts to become capable of failing. The first
  asserted that *something* carried a deadline, which the Vault already
  satisfied. The second asserted that a *quest* did, which world quests --
  same objective type, different provider -- also already satisfied. Both
  passed with the code under test deleted. The third asks the Quests provider
  directly. Recorded because this is the third time in this project that a
  test has agreed with a bug, and the pattern is always the same: asserting on
  an aggregate that something else already satisfies.
- Bounding the offer table naively made `Recommend(25)` seventy times slower
  -- pruning fired on every insert once the table was full. It now overshoots
  by a quarter before sweeping. A fix for a memory leak that costs seventy
  times the CPU is not a fix.

## [0.28.0]

Time, focus, and one performance bug I put there myself.

### Added

- **`/cn plan 30` -- what fits in the time you actually have.** The most
  common shape a play session has, and the addon had nothing to say about it.
  It could rank everything and route between stops, and could not answer the
  one question a person with a job and a bedtime asks before logging in.
  The estimate is built from two halves and only one of them is guessed.
  **Travel is computed** -- the router knows real yard distances, and the
  addon now measures how fast you actually move by watching your position,
  discarding flight paths and loading screens as implausible. **Task time is
  learned**, timed from when something was first put in front of you, kept as
  a median per type. Until a type has been watched enough times it has *no*
  estimate, and the plan says "time unknown" rather than inventing one.
  A plan therefore starts honest and vague and sharpens as it watches you
  play. That is slower to become useful than a table of made-up constants and
  it is the only version that is ever true.
- **`/cn mode leveling` -- aim the whole addon in one command.** Levelling,
  collecting, reputation, achievements, professions, everything. A focus sets
  the weighting *and* the type filter together, because "I'm levelling
  tonight" means both "prefer quests" and "stop showing me pets", and making
  someone say that twice is the addon asking them to do its filing.
  `/cn mode off` restores exactly what you had -- including types *you* had
  hidden before, which the addon must not quietly undo.
- The Journey tab gained one-click 30-minute and 1-hour plans.

### Changed

- **Urgency is a gradient now, not a flag.** A world quest with four days left
  and one with nine minutes left used to score identically, which is exactly
  backwards at the moment it matters. Anything carrying a deadline now gains
  weight on a curve that stays flat until the last two hours and then climbs
  hard -- steeply enough that the final ten minutes outrank the previous
  hour, deliberately late so that "urgent" keeps meaning something.
- `/cn mode` absorbed the new focus presets rather than sitting beside a
  second command that also meant "what am I doing tonight". A bare profile
  name still sets only the weighting, as before.

### Fixed

- **A performance regression I shipped in 0.27.0.** Follow mode asks three
  questions per redraw -- is this stop finished, what does the header say,
  what does the body say -- and each one walked the entire candidate list and
  built a throwaway set of several thousand keys. Three full scans every
  three seconds for an answer that could not have changed between them.
  The index is now memoised against the candidate generation, so it is built
  once per actual change instead of once per question. The test asserts four
  consecutive redraw queries cost at most one walk; it currently costs zero.

### Notes

- The urgency test compares the curve's slope *per second* rather than raw
  differences between unequally spaced samples. The first version of it
  failed a correct curve, which is the test being wrong rather than the code
  -- worth recording, because a test that fails for the wrong reason teaches
  you to distrust the suite.

## [0.27.0]

Four things, all of them traceable to one player's report of what he was
actually doing.

### Fixed

- **"It now says '0 available to pick up here' but I'm literally standing in
  front of one."** The count asked one map: the one under the player's feet.
  `GetBestMapForUnit` answers with the most *specific* map containing you --
  a city, a cave, a building -- while quest starts belonging to the
  surrounding zone are registered against the **parent**. Standing in a city
  and being told there is nothing here was not a rare edge case; it was the
  expected result of asking the wrong map.
  The search now covers the neighbourhood: your map, its parent, and the
  parent's other children. Continents are excluded -- that is a scan, not a
  lookup.
- **Talking to someone now counts.** A conversation cannot be wrong about
  what it is offering, while map data can simply be absent. Quests an NPC has
  offered you are remembered for fifteen minutes and counted as available,
  which covers the case where no map query knows about the pin at all.
  Accepting the quest forgets it immediately.
- World quests and bonus objectives are counted **separately** rather than
  folded in. They are available in the dictionary sense and they are not what
  a player means by "quests I can pick up here" -- there is no exclamation
  mark and nobody to talk to. Folding them in makes the number stop matching
  what is on the screen, which was the entire complaint.
- **`/cn whyzero`** explains the count: every map that was asked, what each
  answered, and why each answer was rejected. When this is wrong again, the
  first question will be "which source found it", and now there is an answer.

### Added

- **Quest progress is back, and it is a real number.** *"It doesn't show how
  many quests I've completed anymore, which I kinda liked seeing."* It was
  removed in 0.26.1 along with the bookkeeping figure it was tangled up in.
  It returns as the client's own lifetime total -- correct on a fresh install
  with no scan history, unlike the count of rows this addon had written.
  `/cn progress` shows lifetime, today, this session, your best day, and a
  rate once the session is long enough for one to mean anything.
- **`/cn loremaster` -- zones, continents and expansions.** For the player
  whose stated plan is *"complete every main quest and side quest in the
  entire game"*, the next hundred yards is not the unit of progress. This
  reads the game's own quest achievements, which have criteria the client
  enumerates, and shows which zone is closest to finished. The progress is
  real because it was read rather than computed.
- Story and side quests are counted separately, because *"finish the story,
  then do the side quests"* is how players actually talk and the client knows
  which is which.
- **`/cn follow` -- follow mode.** Everything this addon knew was something
  you had to ask for: type a command, read a list, close it, play from
  memory. Follow mode puts the current stop on screen, ticks items off as you
  finish them, and moves to the next stop when this one is clear, with the
  arrow already pointed the right way.
  Off by default. It will not move the waypoint out from under you: it
  advances when the stop is **done**, not on a timer. Wander off and it
  re-plans around where you actually are rather than herding you back. It
  says nothing in chat while it runs.
- A **Journey** tab holding the long view: lifetime and daily counts, this
  zone's completion, the zones closest to finished, and a button to start
  following.

### Notes

- The harness hit Lua's 200-local ceiling for a single function. Test
  sections are now immediately-invoked functions rather than `do` blocks: a
  `do` block shares the enclosing function's register budget, a function gets
  its own. This is a structural fix, not a workaround -- the file can now
  grow.
- The project page regained the "what it tracks" table. It was dropped in
  0.25.0 when the page was rewritten around new features -- which left the
  page describing what the addon had just learned to do and no longer saying
  what it covers. A reader deciding whether to install it needs the second
  thing more than the first.
- The zone-completion denominators are the game's, not ours. Counting "quests
  I know about" would give a denominator that grows as you play, so the
  percentage would fall as you did more. That is worse than no percentage,
  and this addon has a standing rule against inventing one.

## [0.26.1]

Reported from live play, again: *"the '0 New' just confuses me -- I feel like
'0 New' should show the amount of quests in the zone that are available but
not accepted."*

He is right, and this one was worse than a bug.

### Fixed

- **The addon was showing a player a number about itself.** "New" counted rows
  written to the addon's own database for the first time. That is a scanner
  statistic: accurate, and permanently zero once a zone has been walked, since
  there is nothing left to record. A player reads "0 new" while looking at
  exclamation marks on their screen and reasonably concludes the addon is
  broken.
  0.23.0 fixed the *cause* of that number sitting at zero. It never asked
  whether the number belonged in front of a player at all. It did not.
- Quest scans now report **how many quests are available to pick up where you
  are standing** -- a fact about the world, which keeps being true after the
  database has seen everything. The bookkeeping figure still exists and now
  goes to debug output, where it was always the only thing it was useful for.
- The Scans panel leads with the same number and demotes the database counts
  to one dim line, in that order. A player reads the top line and stops.

### Added

- **`/cn available`** lists them, with coordinates: what is on offer here that
  you have not taken. A count you cannot act on is half an answer.
- The test suite now pins the *meaning*, not just the value: the count must
  survive repeated scanning, because availability is a fact about the zone and
  not about what the addon has recorded. Reverting to the old definition fails
  the build.

## [0.26.0]

Chase something.

### Added

- **`/cn chase` â€” what actually stands between you and the thing you want.**
  Pinning a goal has always re-weighted the list. It never said what the
  *path* was: which steps remain, how many are already behind you, or which
  one to go and do now. A goal was a preference, not a plan.
  Now a goal becomes an ordered chain. Each step carries a state -- done,
  next, to do, blocked -- and the one immediate move is marked and coloured so
  it can be found without reading the rest. `/cn chase mount 1234` pins it and
  prints the path in one go, because asking how to get something is the
  clearest possible way of saying you want it.
- **Progress, where the game will vouch for it.** Achievement criteria and
  reputation standing have denominators the client supplies, so those get a
  real bar and a real percentage. Chasing Revered now reads *"1,200 of 3,000
  reputation, next: 1,800 to the next rank"* rather than a name and a shrug.
- **The Goals panel is now a chase view.** The selected goal expands into its
  chain, with completed steps struck through in green and the next one in the
  addon's blue. The button says *Next step* rather than *Navigate*, because
  those are different destinations -- the mount may be behind a dungeon you
  cannot enter, while its attunement quest is forty yards away.
- Names now come from the client when the addon has not scanned the thing
  yet. Pinning an unscanned faction used to answer *"Faction 2600"*, which is
  the addon admitting it did not look.


- **`_curseforge/DESCRIPTION.md` and `_curseforge/SUMMARY.txt` now ship with
  the code.** The CurseForge page was written fresh at upload time, which
  meant the only copy of it lived inside a web form: it could not be diffed,
  it was never reviewed alongside the change that made it true, and it drifted
  from what had actually shipped. It is now versioned next to the changelog,
  scaffolded by `init` like every other file, and excluded from the packaged
  addon by `.pkgmeta` -- it belongs in the repository, not in a player's
  AddOns folder.
- The house rules for that copy are enforced rather than written down. The
  test suite fails the build on superlatives, on claims of being the best or
  only anything, on promises about outcomes, on a summary over CurseForge's
  256-character limit, and on any HTML comment in the description. A rule that
  lives only in a comment is a rule that survives exactly as long as the
  person who remembers it.
- **Internal notes moved out of the published file.** The description carried
  its own editing rules in an HTML comment at the top. That is invisible in a
  rendered page and plainly readable to anyone who opens the file or pastes it
  somewhere that does not render Markdown -- a private note published by
  accident. The rules now live in `_curseforge/RULES.md`, which is not the
  file anyone pastes, and the description opens with its title.

### Notes

- **An appearance deliberately gets no progress bar.** An appearance needs
  *one* of its sources, not all of them, so "1 of 9 sources" would suggest
  eight remaining for something already collected. It lists every source and
  says plainly that any one is enough.
  The same rule kills the bar for anything whose only known source is a
  sentence of English: a mount described as dropping from a rare has no
  denominator, so it gets the sentence and no bar. A progress bar is the most
  confident shape information can take, and this addon does not spend that
  confidence on a guess. The test suite asserts the absence, not just the
  presence -- inventing a fraction fails the build.
- Three new client accessors carry this: full achievement criteria with their
  own counters, reputation remaining to the next rank, and every source of an
  appearance. All read-only, all degrade to "the game does not say".

## [0.25.0]

The route, drawn on the map.

### Added

- **Numbered route pins on the world map.** The addon has been grouping nearby
  work into stops, ordering those stops to minimise walking, and improving the
  order with a second pass -- and showing none of that. You saw a list and an
  arrow, with no way to know that stops three through six were the same camp,
  or that a doubling-back was deliberate.
  Now each stop is a numbered pin, in the order you would walk it. Hovering
  says what you do when you arrive -- pick up, do, hand in -- in that order.
  Clicking navigates there. The next stop wears the addon's blue; the rest are
  dimmed, so "where now" is answerable without reading numbers.
- One pin per stop, not per objective. Twelve overlapping pins on one camp say
  less than a single pin reading "3 -- pick up 2, do 4, hand in 1", and a map
  that becomes unreadable when you have a lot to do fails exactly when it
  matters. Busier stops are drawn larger; a crowded zone draws smaller pins
  rather than fewer, since dropping stops would misrepresent the route.
- `/cn pins` lists the current stops in the chat window, and `/cn pins on|off`
  toggles them. There is a checkbox in the options panel as well. On by
  default: pins are additive and read-only, and appear only on a map you have
  deliberately opened.

### Fixed

- **Zone routes ignored the type filter.** Hiding everything but quests
  changed the recommendation list and left the route alone, so `/cn zone`
  would still walk you to a pet you had explicitly said you did not want to
  see. The filter now applies to routing as well. Collection totals and
  `/cn breakdown` still count everything, as before.
- **The generator shipped stale copies of the test files.** `harness.lua`,
  `bench.lua`, `coverage.sh` and `pstest.sh` existed twice -- once where they
  are actually run, once in the build tree -- and the two drifted. The build
  copies were what shipped, so CI ran a harness older than the one every local
  run had just passed, and reported success for tests that no longer existed.
  There is now one copy of each, and the generator refuses to run if a second
  one reappears.

### Notes

- The pins are drawn for the map you are LOOKING at, which is not always the
  map you are standing in. When you open a zone you are not in, the route is
  ordered by how the stops relate to each other rather than by distance from
  your character -- your coordinates mean nothing on another map, and using
  them anyway produces an ordering that is arbitrary rather than merely
  imperfect.

## [0.24.4]

Consequence of the previous fix. No addon changes.

### Fixed

- **The new toolchain installs into the repository, and the checks started
  reading it.** The install directory is named `.lua`, so a search for files
  matching `*.lua` matched the directory itself and handed it to the compiler,
  which reasonably objected that it is a directory. Underneath it sat several
  thousand third-party files besides, some malformed on purpose because they
  are another project's test fixtures.
  Every search for Lua files is now restricted to regular files and scoped to
  ours, and the linter is configured to match. The rule excludes dotted
  directories as a class rather than naming today's, so the next tool that
  installs somewhere new is already covered.

### Added

- The syntax check now reports how many files it examined and fails if that
  number is implausibly small. A search that matches nothing passes silently,
  which is a worse failure than the one it replaced.
- The test suite plants a deliberately malformed file where the toolchain
  installs and asserts that neither the syntax check nor the linter reads it.

## [0.24.3]

The release pipeline stops depending on the runner's package manager. No addon
changes.

### Fixed

- **The previous fix was the wrong fix, and I should say so plainly.** 0.24.2
  bounded how long `apt-get` would wait for the dpkg lock, on the theory that
  the lock was held briefly at boot. It is not held briefly. Bounding the wait
  changed a build that hung for thirty-eight minutes into a build that failed
  after six, which is better but is not working.
  Lua, LuaRocks and luacheck now come from setup actions that build the
  toolchain into the workspace. There is no shared lock, no package database
  and no other process to contend with, so the entire failure class is gone
  rather than merely reported faster.
- Coverage no longer installs anything of its own, and locates luacov by asking
  LuaRocks where it put it instead of guessing from a list of directories. The
  workspace-local install used by CI appears in none of the paths it guessed.

### Added

- The test suite asserts that Lua arrives from a setup action and not from
  `apt-get`, so a later edit cannot quietly reintroduce the hang.

## [0.24.2]

The other half of the release problem. No addon changes.

### Fixed

- **A hung CI step ran for six hours and looked exactly like a working one.**
  The workflow had no `timeout-minutes` anywhere, so GitHub's six-hour default
  applied. A run that wedged on a package install simply sat "in progress"
  indefinitely -- indistinguishable, from the outside, from one still doing
  useful work. That is why a release appeared to have been pushed successfully
  and then nothing ever arrived.
  The job is now bounded at twenty minutes, and the steps that can realistically
  wedge -- package installs, lint, the harness, coverage -- carry their own
  limits. A hang now fails in minutes and says which step it was.
- Package installs run with `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and
  `--no-install-recommends`. An apt configuration prompt on a runner waits on
  stdin that will never arrive, which is the classic way this happens.
- **The actual hang: apt waits for the dpkg lock forever.** A fresh Ubuntu
  runner starts `unattended-upgrades` at boot, which holds the package lock for
  a minute or two. `apt-get` has no default timeout on that lock -- it blocks
  silently until the lock clears, and if the holder never exits, it blocks until
  the job is killed. Two releases wedged there, one for thirty-eight minutes.
  Every `apt-get` call now carries `DPkg::Lock::Timeout=120`, so it gives up
  after two minutes instead of waiting indefinitely, plus `Acquire::Retries=3`
  for transient mirror failures and an outer three-attempt retry loop. The step
  either installs Lua or fails with a message, within its own six-minute bound.

### Added

- The test suite now asserts the workflow cannot hang: there must be a job-level
  timeout, and it must be short enough that a wedged run is noticed rather than
  discovered hours later. It also asserts that every `apt-get` invocation in the
  workflow carries an explicit dpkg lock timeout, so this specific hang cannot
  be reintroduced by a later edit.

## [0.24.1]

A release-blocking defect in CI. No addon changes.

### Fixed

- **CI silently stopped releases from reaching CurseForge.** The coverage step
  added in 0.21.0 hardcoded the luacov path from the author's machine
  (`/usr/local/share/lua/5.1`). On any host where luarocks installed luacov
  somewhere else -- which includes the GitHub runner -- the script died under
  `set -e` producing **no output at all**, the workflow stopped, and the
  packager never ran. The tag was pushed, the release was validated, the log
  looked almost fine, and no file appeared.
  `coverage.sh` now locates luacov wherever the machine put it, and when it
  genuinely cannot run it says so and exits successfully. A quality signal for
  the author is not a reason to deny users a build.
- The coverage step is marked `continue-on-error`. Lint and the harness still
  block a release, because those mean the addon is broken. Missing developer
  tooling does not.

### Added

- **The test suite now checks the CI workflow itself.** Any step that could
  block a release must either be on an allow-list of things that indicate
  genuinely broken code, or carry `continue-on-error`. Adding a fragile step
  in front of the packager now fails the suite rather than a release.
- A test that runs `coverage.sh` with luacov deliberately unreachable and
  requires it to exit zero with an explanation.

## [0.24.0]

Stop running back and forth.

### Added

- **A quest is now three places, not one.** PICKUP, ACTIVE, TURNIN. Treating a
  quest as a single point is exactly why an addon sends you across a zone and
  back: it cannot tell that two quests share a giver, or that four you are
  carrying all hand in at the same NPC. Naming the phase is what makes
  batching possible at all, and every quest recommendation now says which one
  it is -- *pick up*, *work on*, *turn in*.
- **Routes are planned between places, not between objectives.** Stops within
  about seventy yards of each other collapse into one hub, the route is solved
  hub to hub, and within a hub the order is the order you would actually do it:
  collect the quests, do the work, hand them back. `/cn zone` prints it that
  way -- *"3 things here -- pick up 2, turn in 1"* -- and says how many of your
  stops share a place with something else.
  Single-link clustering, so a row of quest givers strung along a road becomes
  one stop rather than four.
- **The engine prefers work that batches**, rather than only displaying it that
  way. An objective sharing a place with others scores higher than an identical
  one standing alone, capped so a big cluster cannot drown out something
  genuinely urgent. Without this the *route* would batch while the
  *recommendation* still sent you across the zone for one quest.

### Notes

- Distances for clustering are computed in real yards through the client's
  world positions, falling back to a scaled normalized distance when the client
  will not convert. Clustering on raw map coordinates would make hubs enormous
  in small zones and useless in large ones, because map coordinates are
  normalized per map.
- The harness outgrew Lua's 200-local limit for a single function. Self-
  contained test sections are now scoped, which is better hygiene than it
  sounds: it also stops one section's fixtures leaking into the next.

## [0.23.0]

Reported from live play: *"it only shows the quests you have accepted -- I
don't see where it shows the quest pending to be accepted in the zone"*, and
*"'new' is always 0"*.

Both were the same defect, and it was a bad one.

### Fixed

- **The addon could not see a quest until you had already accepted it.**
  Every quest source it read was the quest log, which by definition contains
  only quests you have already taken. So the exclamation marks standing in
  front of you -- often the single best next action available -- were
  structurally invisible, and an addon whose entire purpose is answering
  *"what should I do next?"* could never answer *"go and pick that up"*.
  The client had the data the whole time. `C_QuestLog.GetQuestsOnMap` returns
  every quest pin with an `isQuestStart` flag, and the addon called that same
  function from the first build -- but only ever to ask "where is this one
  quest I already have?", discarding everything else it returned.
  Available quests now become recommendations, with their names, their pin
  coordinates, and a reason that says what they are. They are weighted above
  an accepted quest you have not started, because walking twenty yards to
  collect one is the cheaper action and it unlocks whatever follows.
- **`new` was permanently zero.** Discovery walked the quest log and nothing
  else, so once your own quests had been scanned there was nothing left to
  discover, ever. It now records available quests too, and counts them.
- Available quests flow into `/cn zone`, so a zone sweep routes you past the
  quests you have not picked up rather than only the ones you have.

### Notes

- The harness stub was complicit. It returned a single in-log quest from
  `GetQuestsOnMap` and no quest starts at all, so the test data had exactly
  the same blind spot as the code and could never have caught this. It now
  returns in-log quests, offered quests, a daily, and a quest start for
  something already completed -- and the suite asserts the completed one is
  never offered again.
- Found by a player, not by a test. That is the second time a stub modelled
  the world too simply and hid a real defect; the pattern to watch for is test
  data that only contains the cases the code already handles.

## [0.22.0]

`/cn why` has been able to explain why a quest is locked since the first build,
and has had almost nothing to explain it with. This release gives it data.

### Added

- **Prerequisites inferred from repeated play, and gated on confidence.**
  The addon has always noted which quests you turned in shortly before
  accepting another. One such observation is the order you happened to play in
  and nothing more, so it was never used for anything.
  Observations now accumulate **per distinct character**, and only cross into
  the dependency graph once **three different characters** show the same
  ordering. Independent playthroughs do not agree by accident, and an alt
  cannot inherit a coincidence. Repeating a chain on one character does not
  raise confidence -- doing something twice is still one character's opinion.
- **Inference is never presented as fact.** Confident edges are published as
  `observedRequires`, never `requires`, and `/cn why` reports them as *"probably
  needs another quest first"* with the character count attached, not as the
  flat statement a curated prerequisite produces. The harness asserts an
  inferred edge can never be written as a curated one.
- `/cn export` and `.\cn.ps1 harvest` write confident observations as real
  `requires` rows and everything below the threshold as a comment with its
  character count, so curation never has to guess which lines were inferred.

### Fixed

- **Observed prerequisites could only ever apply to quests that already had
  curated data.** The check sat inside the branch that runs when a static
  record exists -- the exact opposite of the point, since inference matters
  most where curation is absent. Found by a test that expected a block and got
  silence.
- **The correlation window now clears on login.** A quest accepted in a new
  session could otherwise be correlated with one turned in before the last
  logout. The 300-second window covered that in most cases, and "most" is how
  a false prerequisite gets recorded and then repeated until it looks
  confident.

### Notes

- Schema 3 -> 4. Existing observations are preserved and credited to one
  unknown character each -- deliberately *below* the promotion threshold, so
  data gathered before the addon counted characters is never promoted on the
  strength of a count it never made.
- Delves were assessed and deliberately not built. `C_DelvesUI` exposes UI
  plumbing, not progress, and delve credit toward the Great Vault already
  flows through the World row added in 0.18.0. A separate module would have
  been guesswork duplicating something that already works.

## [0.21.0]

### Added

- **Per-character settings.** Priority mode, auto-advance, the arrow and
  tooltips can each be set for one character instead of the whole account.
  `/cn perchar priorityMode` takes control of a setting; running it again hands
  it back. A max-level main and a levelling alt want different answers, and the
  character you are on should decide that rather than the last one you changed
  it on.
  Overrides are stored sparsely -- only what a character explicitly took over --
  so a default changed in a later release still reaches everyone, instead of
  being frozen at whatever it was when the override was made. Schema 2 -> 3;
  nothing moves, and every existing character starts with no overrides at all.
- **LibDataBroker feed.** Titan Panel, ElvUI datatexts and ChocolateBar can
  show the current recommendation, click to open the window, right-click to
  navigate. It is the only external library the addon touches, and it is
  handled like every other optional integration: probed, wrapped, silent when
  absent. `/cn broker` reports whether it resolved.
- **Rare alerts.** `/cn alerts on` announces rares that appear near you, once
  each, only for ones you have not already cleared, reset when you change zone.
  **Off by default** -- unsolicited sound is worse than an uninvited waypoint,
  and the waypoint is already off by default.
- **Coverage measurement**, wired into the test suite and CI with an 80% floor.
  A suite whose reach nobody measures drifts: it keeps passing while covering
  less and less. Currently **85%**.

### Fixed

- **The TomTom provider had never been executed by a single test.** Coverage
  found it at 41% -- it shipped in every release with no test able to reach it,
  because no TomTom existed to probe. It is stubbed now, and the suite asserts
  that choosing TomTom actually routes waypoints through TomTom rather than
  silently keeping the native one.
- **`cn.ps1` wrote shell scripts with CRLF line endings.** A CRLF shell script
  fails with `$'\r': command not found`, which reads like a corrupt file rather
  than a line-ending problem. `.sh`, `.yml` and `.yaml` are now written LF,
  since those are the files a Linux CI runner executes.

## [0.20.1]

The arrow pointed the wrong way. This fixes it, and fixes the reason the tests
did not catch it.

### Fixed

- **The navigation arrow pointed at the reciprocal of the target.** Following
  it increased the distance while it still showed blue for "on course", because
  the colour and the direction were computed from the same wrong number and so
  agreed with each other.
  The cause: 0 is north on every client, but whether `GetPlayerFacing()` grows
  as you turn left or as you turn right is a convention, and 0.19.0 assumed the
  wrong one.

### Changed

- **The arrow now works the convention out for itself.** If you are lined up
  with it, moving, and the distance is *growing*, the arrow is demonstrably
  backwards -- so it flips, says so once, and remembers. Several consecutive
  samples are required, so walking backwards, a flight path or a loading screen
  cannot trigger it. `/cn calibrate` forces the flip by hand.
- **The bearing tests were the real defect.** Seven cases "verified" 0.19.0,
  and every one of them computed its expected answer from the same assumption
  the code used -- so the tests agreed with the bug. A test that encodes the
  premise it is meant to check proves nothing.
  They are rewritten around properties that hold under *either* convention:
  facing the target is zero, facing away is a half turn, east and west are a
  quarter turn in opposite directions, and turning by the reported bearing must
  line you up. The suite now also asserts that the two conventions genuinely
  differ, and that the self-correction fires when the distance grows and stays
  put when it shrinks.

## [0.20.0]

### Fixed

- **The arrow reported "distance unknown" for every target.** 0.19.0 passed a
  `UiMapPoint` to `C_Map.GetWorldPosFromMapPos`, which wants a `Vector2D`.
  They are different types -- `UiMapPoint` carries a nested `position`,
  `Vector2D` carries `x` and `y` directly -- and they are easy to confuse
  because both describe a point. `SetUserWaypoint` wants the first, this wants
  the second.
  The harness stub modelled both as the same flat shape, which is exactly why
  the test passed while the addon failed. The stub now models each correctly
  and asserts the right type is passed; reintroducing the bug fails the suite.

### Added

- **Filter what you get recommended.** `/cn show` chooses which kinds of
  objective appear: `/cn show pets` toggles one, `/cn show only quests`
  narrows to a single kind, `/cn show all` restores everything. The **Next**
  tab has a *Filter types* button with the same checklist.
  Only hidden types are stored, so a kind added in a later release is visible
  by default rather than silently missing for everyone who upgraded. Filtering
  is applied to the ranked list, never to collection -- `/cn breakdown` and the
  Collections tab still see everything -- and when a filter empties the list
  the Next tab says so instead of looking broken.

- **Mounts, toys, professions and appearances are now recommendations.** Four
  subsystems that the addon has scanned, stored and reported since early
  builds registered no candidate provider at all, so they could never appear
  in `/cn next`. Pets had one; mounts did not. That was an omission, not a
  design decision, and it meant the Collections priority mode weighted types
  that could never surface.
  - **Mounts** are recommended only where the journal supplies a source --
    *"Vendor: X"*, *"Quest: Y"*, *"Drop: Z"*. A mount locked to the other
    faction is never suggested.
  - **Toys** join the vendor database exactly, because both are keyed by item
    ID, so an uncollected toy a recorded vendor sells becomes an objective
    with real coordinates.
  - **Professions** below their cap, weighted so the last few points rank
    above a profession barely started.
  - **Appearances** surface the least-complete slots only, capped at three.
- **2-opt route improvement.** `/cn zone` built its route with greedy
  nearest-neighbour, which has a characteristic failure: it takes the locally
  cheap step every time, strands one far objective, and doubles back for it at
  the end. A 2-opt pass now uncrosses the route. On the harness's crossed test
  case it removes **21.6%** of the distance.

### Notes

- **Titles deliberately do NOT get a provider, and the harness asserts it.**
  A recommendation has to name an action, and the client exposes a title's
  name and whether you have it -- no source, no coordinates, no criteria.
  *"You do not have Loremaster"* is a fact, not a next action. Titles remain
  fully tracked in `/cn titles`, `/cn who title`, the Collections tab and
  `/cn breakdown`, and one you actually want can be pinned with
  `/cn goal title <id>`. Shipping a fifth provider to close a checklist item
  would have put rows with no route into a list whose entire purpose is to be
  actionable.
- The Goals test previously proved its point using an uncollected mount, on
  the premise that one is never a candidate. Mounts gained a provider and that
  premise quietly became false -- the test caught it, and now uses a title,
  which has no provider by design.

## [0.19.0]

Completion Navigator no longer needs any other addon to navigate.

### Added

- **Native navigation.** An on-screen arrow that points at your destination,
  turns as you turn, and reports real distance in yards.
  TomTom was never a dependency on paper -- every access was probed and
  wrapped -- but in practice it was: without it you got a static map pin and no
  arrow, which is not navigation. That gap is closed.
- **The arrow is the addon's own.** Custom artwork, tinted with the blue of
  the waypoint marker in the Completion Navigator logo (`#5DD2FB`), sampled
  from the logo rather than guessed. It turns gold when you drift off course
  and red when you are walking away, so the colour carries information rather
  than only branding. Drag it anywhere; the position is saved.
- **Real distance, in yards.** Map coordinates are normalized per map, so the
  same 0.1 difference is a different real distance in every zone. The arrow
  converts through the client's world positions and reports yards -- and
  reports *"distance unknown"* rather than a made-up figure when the client
  cannot convert.
- **Arrival detection.** Getting within twelve yards fires arrival, which is
  what auto-advance was designed around; before this it could only re-point on
  a timer or an event.
- **`/cn nav`** chooses the provider: `auto` (native), `tomtom`, or
  `blizzard`. TomTom users who prefer its arrow keep it with one command.
  `/cn arrow` toggles the arrow, `/cn here` reports where you are and what is
  being tracked.

### Changed

- Native navigation is now the preferred waypoint provider, ahead of TomTom.
  It is the only provider that cannot be missing.
- Routing no longer suggests installing TomTom when nothing is available,
  because that is no longer the reason.

### Notes

- The bearing maths is the kind that is invisible when wrong -- a reversed sign
  points you confidently at the wrong place and raises no error. Seven cardinal
  cases are asserted in the harness, along with the yard conversion, the
  arrival threshold, and the refusal to compute a bearing to another map.

## [0.18.0]

### Added

- **The Great Vault.** `/cn vault`, a **Vault** tab, and vault progress as real
  recommendations.
  This is the only system in the game that supplies all three things the addon
  normally has to guess at -- a hard deadline, a known denominator, and a known
  reward -- so it is the one place a percentage is a fact rather than an
  estimate. A row one activity short of a threshold, with the reset approaching,
  is the most actionable thing this addon can offer: *"one more Heroic before
  Tuesday unlocks a second reward."*
  Capped rows are never recommended, because they cannot be advanced. An
  unclaimed reward from last week outranks everything -- it is free, it takes
  thirty seconds, and it is destroyed when the vault next fills.
- **luacheck static analysis**, configured for the WoW client surface so a
  warning is worth reading. The baseline is zero, enforced by the test suite
  and by CI.
- **CI now runs the tests.** `release.yml` previously syntax-checked Lua and
  verified the `.toc` but never ran the harness -- the full suite ran only on
  the author's machine, which meant a release could ship with it failing and
  nothing would say so. The harness and the benchmark now ship with the source
  and run on every tagged build.

### Changed

- Precedence between goals and expiring content is now explicit and tested. A
  pinned goal outranks everything merely *available*; it does not outrank
  something with a deadline. A vault slot expires on Tuesday and an uncollected
  mount will still be there next week, and special-casing goals out of urgency
  weighting would have been wrong. The harness asserts both halves.

### Fixed

- `harness.lua` had two shadowed locals that made two halves of the file look
  independent when they were not. Found by luacheck on its first run.
- Test tooling is excluded from the `.toc`, the addon zip and the packaging
  step. `harness.lua` stubs the entire client API, so a copy of it in a
  player's AddOns folder would replace live client functions with fakes.

## [0.17.0]

### Added

- **Goals.** `/cn goal <type> <id>` pins something you have decided you want.
  A goal becomes a candidate in its own right -- an uncollected mount is not
  normally a next action, which is exactly why saying you want it has to mean
  something -- and anything that leads to it ranks higher and says so.
  `/cn goals` prints what is actually known about reaching each one: the
  source, where it is, which of your characters is best placed, and the next
  concrete step. Where nothing is known it says so, and names what would make
  it knowable, rather than inventing a route.
  `/cn ungoal`, `/cn gogoal <n>` to navigate, and a **Goals** tab.
  Types: quest, achievement, mount, pet, toy, recipe, title, rep, rare,
  currency. Goals are account-wide, because deciding you want a mount is not
  a fact about the character you happened to be playing at the time.
- **`.\cn.ps1 harvest`** reads SavedVariables directly and folds harvested
  quests into `Data\Quests.lua`.
  The addon has recorded the name, zone, coordinates and level of every quest
  you accept since the first build, and the only way to get it out was a copy
  box -- so in practice it stayed in SavedVariables and the curated database
  stayed nearly empty. That is what limits prerequisite forensics, and it was
  a tooling gap, not a data gap. Curated rows are never overwritten:
  hand-checked data outranks observed data, the same source-ranking rule the
  addon applies internally. Quests with no coordinates are skipped unless
  you pass `-Force`.

### Fixed

- **Decorators ran once per rebuild instead of once per objective.** 0.16.0's
  per-provider caching means the aggregate list is mostly the *same* objective
  tables as last time, so Warband's "another character is better suited" was
  appended again on every rebuild and stacked up under the recommendation.
  Decoration now happens when a provider builds its objectives. Regression
  test asserts no objective is ever decorated twice.
- **An explicit action no longer waits on a cooldown.** Cooldowns exist to
  stop a chatty *event* from causing work; they were also delaying things the
  player just did on purpose, so a newly pinned goal could take two seconds to
  appear. Invalidation with no event reason -- a scan finishing, a login, a
  goal changing -- now bypasses cooldowns.

### Notes

- `Data\Quests.lua` still ships nearly empty. `harvest` is the mechanism that
  changes that; it needs people to play with the addon loaded first.

## [0.16.1]

A Windows-only defect in 0.16.0's release path. No addon changes.

### Fixed

- **`release` died mid-push on Windows PowerShell 5.1.** There, stderr from a
  native command under `2>&1` arrives as ErrorRecord objects, and with
  `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` -- set at the top of `cn.ps1` -- the first
  one becomes a terminating error. git writes its ordinary progress to stderr,
  so `git push 2>&1` killed the script on a push that had *succeeded*, leaving
  the tag unpushed and the release invisible to CurseForge.
  Every native invocation now goes through one helper that neutralizes the
  preference for the duration, renders stderr as its message rather than its
  type name, and returns the real exit code.
  This was not caught because the end-to-end test runs PowerShell 7 on Linux,
  which does not behave this way.
- **`check` had the same defect.** `luac.exe` writes syntax errors to stderr,
  so the first malformed file would have terminated the whole check rather
  than being reported alongside the others.
- **`doctor` sorted remote tags as strings**, which put `v0.9.0` above
  `v0.15.0` and made "newest remote tags" actively misleading. Sorted by
  version number now.
- A failed push prints the two commands that finish the release by hand,
  rather than leaving you to work them out.

## [0.16.0]

Measured, not guessed. A benchmark against a retail-scale database -- 1800
pets, 3000 achievements, 500 factions, 2500 recipes -- drove every change
below. Numbers are from that benchmark.

### Changed

- **The ranked list is cached.** 0.15.0 cached the candidate list but still
  re-scored and re-sorted every candidate on every call, so `/cn next` cost
  **14.8ms** even with a warm cache. It is now **0.01ms**. A frame at 60fps is
  16ms, which means the minimap tooltip added in 0.15.0 was dropping a frame
  every time you hovered it. That was a regression I shipped, and this is the
  fix.
- **Invalidation is per provider.** Each provider declares which events can
  make it stale, so learning a mount no longer rebuilds the achievement
  candidates. `NEW_MOUNT_ADDED` went from **18.3ms to 0.02ms**;
  `UPDATE_FACTION` from **6.6ms to 0.01ms**; `CRITERIA_UPDATE` from **8.5ms to
  1.1ms**.
- **Chatty events are throttled at the cache, not just at the scan.**
  `CRITERIA_UPDATE` and `UPDATE_FACTION` fire many times a second during normal
  play. Providers subscribed to them rebuild at most once every five seconds.
- **Providers that enumerate a whole collection are capped.** Emitting 1200
  uncollected pets so that one can rank first is waste, and every one of them
  scores identically. The highest-valued 60 per provider are kept, chosen by
  counting rather than sorting, with ties broken by ID so the list does not
  reshuffle. Candidate count dropped from **3211 to 189**. `/cn perf` reports
  exactly what was dropped -- a cap nobody can see reads as "that was
  everything".
- **Ignore and defer lookups short-circuit when nothing is hidden.** They were
  building a `TYPE:id` string per call, several thousand times per rebuild,
  to look up nothing. **12ms to 3.5ms** per 10,000 pairs.
- A full rebuild is down from **45.2ms to 16.5ms**, and now only happens on a
  scan or a login rather than on every event.
- Ranking sorts a copy. Zone routing walks the candidate list, and having it
  reordered underneath as a side effect of somebody asking for a
  recommendation was a bug waiting to be found.

### Fixed

- **`release` no longer half-applies.** It bumped the version files and *then*
  checked the changelog, so a stale `CHANGELOG.md` left the tree claiming a
  version whose source had never been scaffolded -- and said so in a yellow
  warning that scrolled past. Every refusal now happens before anything is
  written, and says "nothing has been changed" out loud.
- **A failing `check` aborts the release** instead of printing above it and
  carrying on.
- **`cn.ps1` stamps the version it carries.** A `cn.ps1` older than the tree
  used to scaffold a previous release over the top and report success. `check`
  now fails on it, and `release` refuses a version this file does not carry.
- **An existing tag is detected** rather than letting `git tag` fail into the
  middle of a release.
- **Push failures are caught.** `git push` and `git push --tags` are checked,
  so a tag that never reached the remote is reported rather than assumed.
- git's stderr is rendered as its message rather than
  `System.Management.Automation.RemoteException`.
- **`init` scaffolds `Media\Logo.tga`.** A fresh scaffold previously failed its
  own `check` on a missing IconTexture, which then blocked `release`.
- Rescanning a store no longer invalidates every provider -- only the ones that
  read it. Mounts, toys, appearances and titles feed no candidate provider at
  all, so scanning them now invalidates nothing.

### Added

- **`.\cn.ps1 doctor`** reports the whole release chain in one place: toolkit
  version, tree version, changelog section, HEAD, tags at HEAD, uncommitted
  changes, remote, and whether the expected tag has actually been pushed. Written because diagnosing a release that silently did nothing
  meant assembling five separate commands by hand.
- `/cn perf` reports per-provider cache state and any caps hit.

## [0.15.0]

### Added

- **Tooltips.** Item tooltips now say what the addon already knew: whether a
  toy, mount, battle pet or appearance is collected, whether this character
  knows a recipe and which of your characters does, and which recorded
  vendor sells the item and where they stand. Unit tooltips identify a
  merchant you have already shopped at.
  Nothing is added to items the addon knows nothing about â€” an appearance
  line only appears where the item genuinely has an appearance source, so
  the addon stays off every stack of ore in the game. `/cn tooltips` toggles
  the whole thing, and reports which tooltip API resolved.
- **`/cn setup`.** Runs all eleven subsystem scans in order, one per frame,
  then names the two things it cannot do for you: recipes and vendor
  inventories are readable only while their windows are open.
  A new install previously had to discover eleven separate scan commands,
  and looked broken until it did. The first login now prints a single
  pointer to this command and then stays quiet.
- The minimap button tooltip shows the current recommendation and its top
  reasons, so the most common question the addon answers no longer requires
  opening anything.
- Settings tab gains a tooltip toggle and a **Scan everything now** button.

### Changed

- **Candidates are cached.** Nine providers were being rebuilt on every
  `/cn next`, every window refresh and every auto-advance tick, several of
  them walking thousands of records. Results are now held for five seconds
  and invalidated by the sixteen events that can actually change an answer.
- `/cn perf` reports cache state and per-provider timings, slowest first, so
  a slow provider can be identified rather than guessed at.

## [0.14.0]

### Added

- **Managing what you hid.** `/cn hidden` lists everything ignored or
  deferred, with real names rather than internal keys. `/cn unhide <id>`
  restores one, `/cn unhide all` restores everything.
  Ignore and defer have existed since the first build with no way to see
  either list or undo anything in them. Ignoring something by accident
  meant it was gone permanently, which is a bug wearing a feature's
  clothes.
- Expired deferrals are pruned at login instead of accumulating in
  SavedVariables forever.
- **Vendors.** Every merchant you open is recorded permanently: what they
  sell, and where they stand. `/cn sells <item>` finds who sells something,
  `/cn tovendor <item>` routes you there, `/cn vendors` summarizes.
- Recipes you do not know that a recorded vendor sells now become
  recommendations with real coordinates. This is the missing link in the
  design's flagship example: everything else it needed already existed, but
  nothing knew where anything was sold.

### Fixed

- **NPC IDs were never parsed.** `tonumber(select(6, strsplit("-", guid)))`
  passes every remaining GUID field to `tonumber`, so the spawn UID arrived
  as the `base` argument and the call threw. Every vendor capture would have
  failed in game. Wrapping the `select` in parentheses truncates it to one
  value.

### Notes

- Vendor inventories, like trade skill recipes, are only readable while the
  window is open. So the vendor database grows as you play rather than
  shipping stale, and only vendors you have actually opened are known.


## [0.13.0]

### Added

- **Auto-advancing waypoints.** `/cn auto`, or the Settings checkbox. When
  the thing you were pointed at is finished, the waypoint moves to whatever
  is worth doing next. Off by default: taking over the waypoint uninvited
  is hostile, and TomTom arrows are shared with every other addon.
  It re-points when the objective *changes*, not on a timer, because a
  waypoint that silently moves while you walk to it is worse than one that
  never moves. A slow backstop ticker covers objectives that expire rather
  than complete, such as a world quest running out while you stand still.
- **Three new tabs: Now, Warband and Remaining.** Everything added since
  0.9 was reachable only by typing, which broke this addon's own rule that
  the keyboard is the power-user path and not the required one.
  The Now tab merges world quests, live rares, capped currencies and
  unfilled weekly earning into one clickable list.
- **Exploration.** Per-zone subzone discovery, with the names of the places
  you have not been. Zones closest to finishing are surfaced first.
  `/cn exploration`, `/cn explorescan`.
- **HandyNotes provider.** Reads registered HandyNotes plugins for treasure
  and rare coordinates. It never answers quest lookups, so it cannot
  contribute wrong prerequisite data.

### Fixed

- Tab buttons ran off the edge of the window once there were more than about
  six. Tabs are a registry any module can add to, so they now wrap to a
  second row and the panel below moves down to match, rather than the window
  being widened to fit today's count.
- "1 plugins" in provider diagnostics.

### Notes

- The exploration achievement category is the only countable exploration
  data the client exposes. The map API reports which overlays you have
  revealed but never how many exist, so a true "percent explored" cannot be
  computed. Per-subzone criteria are more actionable anyway: they name the
  place you have not been.


## [0.12.0]

### Added

- **"Why isn't this 100%?"** `/cn breakdown` explains what is left in every
  category and why, with a concrete next action per line rather than a bare
  count. `/cn breakdown <category>` for one at a time.
  Percentages appear only where the denominator is trustworthy. The client
  knows how many mounts exist; nothing knows how many quests exist. Where a
  total is unknowable the addon says so and shows counts, instead of
  inventing a number that looks authoritative.
- **Currencies.** Caps and weekly earning, tracked per character.
  A capped currency is earning potential being thrown away, so it surfaces
  as a time-sensitive recommendation to go spend it. Unfilled weekly caps
  are reported because they reset whether you use them or not.
  `/cn currencies`, `/cn currencyscan`.

### Fixed

- Singular/plural agreement in breakdown output. "1 are locked to the
  opposite faction" reads as a bug even when the number is correct.


## [0.11.0]

### Added

- **Rares and treasures**, driven by the client's vignette data rather than a
  static spawn database. A vignette is the only live signal that a rare is
  actually up right now, which is the half of the question static data
  cannot answer and which goes stale every patch.
  `/cn rares` lists what is up, `/cn rare <n>` routes to it, `/cn raredb`
  summarizes everything recorded.
- Rares and treasures feed the recommendation engine as time-sensitive
  objectives, because something that is up now and dead when someone else
  finds it is exactly what the limited-time term is for.
- Everything seen is recorded permanently and account-wide, so the addon
  accumulates its own spawn database from play. It cannot go stale, because
  it comes from the live game.
- Vignettes that disappear while the player is nearby are inferred as
  cleared by that character. Recorded as inference, not asserted as fact.
- **Addon artwork.** The .toc IconTexture and the minimap button now use the
  project logo. `.\cn.ps1 icon <file.png>` regenerates `Media\Logo.tga`.

### Fixed

- `check` now verifies that the file `IconTexture` points at actually
  exists. WoW fails silently on a missing texture, so a typo produced a
  blank icon and no error anywhere.
- The minimap button verifies its texture loaded and falls back to a stock
  icon rather than rendering an invisible button.


## [0.10.0]

### Added

- **Opportunity scanner.** World quests, daily and weekly resets, and active
  world events. Urgency is scaled steeply: something with an hour left
  dominates, something with three days left barely registers.
  `/cn now` lists everything expiring, soonest first. `/cn events` lists
  active world events.
- **Warband intelligence.** `/cn warband` shows every known character with
  what each covers, plus the combined coverage across all of them.
  `/cn who <rep, recipe, title or profession> <id or name>` answers which
  character should do a given thing.
- **Candidate decorators.** Cross-cutting concerns now apply to objectives
  from modules that know nothing about them. Warband suitability is the
  first user.

### Fixed

- `limitedTimeBonus` carries the heaviest weight in the scoring formula
  (3.0) and nothing ever set it. The engine was built to prioritise
  expiring content and had no idea what expires.
- `characterSuitability` was likewise weighted and never set.
- **Migrations ran after defaults were merged**, which meant `CopyDefaults`
  had already discarded any stored value whose type no longer matched the
  default. A migration existing to read a legacy value would silently find
  nothing. Migrations now run on the raw saved data first. This affected no
  shipped migration yet; it would have broken every future one.
- Literal `|` characters in command help and usage text were eaten by the
  chat frame as escape sequences: `<factionID|name>` rendered as
  `<factionIDame>`. Every affected string now reads `<factionID or name>`.

### Notes

- Database schema is now version 2. The 1 to 2 migration creates the account
  tables the collection modules added and moves the flat minimap setting into
  its nested form, preserving the player's choice. It is idempotent and is
  covered by a test that starts from a real version 1 database.


## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **Harvesting.** Every quest you pick up or turn in now has its name, zone,
  map, coordinates and observed level recorded permanently and account-wide.
  Playing the game fills the static database. `/cn harvest` shows what has
  been collected; `/cn harvestnow` sweeps the current log.
- **Export.** `/cn export` emits harvested quests as ready-to-paste
  `Data\Quests.lua` rows, so what one player harvests can be committed and
  shipped to everyone. `/cn export all` includes quests with no coordinates.
- **AllTheThings provider.** Reads quest names, coordinates, source quests
  and level requirements from ATT when the player has it installed.
- **BtWQuests provider.** Reads quest names and prerequisite chains,
  including nested prerequisite conditions.
- **Provider registry.** External data sources are merged by priority behind
  one interface. Curated static data always outranks them, because it is the
  only source this addon ships.
- `/cn providers` reports which external addons were detected and which entry
  points resolved. `/cn lookup <questID>` asks all of them about one quest.
- `/cn why` now reports which data source produced its answer, or says
  plainly that no prerequisite data exists for that quest.

### Notes

- Third-party addon internals are not published contracts. Every provider
  access is probed and wrapped, so an ATT or BtWQuests update can make a
  provider go quiet but cannot break Completion Navigator. `/cn providers` is
  how you tell which happened.
- Prerequisites inferred from the order you completed quests are recorded
  separately, never fed to the eligibility checker, and appear in exports as
  commented suggestions for a human to confirm. Correlation is not a
  prerequisite.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- Battle pet collection tracking, including wild/obtainable classification
  and per-species collected counts.
- Mount collection tracking with faction-lock detection, so a mount your
  current character can never use is reported as such rather than as simply
  missing.
- Toy box tracking.
- Transmog appearance progress, reported per category.
- Title tracking, stored per character so the addon can say which alt
  already earned one.
- Achievement tracking focused on near-completion: achievements within two
  criteria of finishing are surfaced and fed to the recommendation engine.
- Profession and recipe tracking, including which characters know which
  recipe.
- A Collections tab showing account-wide completion per category.
- Slash commands for every subsystem: `/cn pets`, `/cn mounts`, `/cn toys`,
  `/cn appearances`, `/cn titles`, `/cn achievements`, `/cn closest`,
  `/cn professions`, `/cn recipes`, and per-item lookups.

### Fixed

- Profession enumeration walked the five profession slots with `ipairs`,
  which stops at the first empty slot. A character without Archaeology
  silently lost Fishing and Cooking.

### Notes

- Recipe lists can only be read while a profession window is open. This is a
  client restriction. The addon captures them automatically the first time
  you open each profession and tells you which are still outstanding rather
  than reporting zero.

## [0.7.0]

### Fixed

- Quest coordinates now come from four client sources rather than one.
  `GetNextWaypoint` answers for very few quests; the map POI list covers
  ordinary ones.
- Quests with no coordinates fall back to Blizzard's own tracking arrow
  instead of refusing to navigate.

### Added

- `/cn where` and `/cn setloc` for inspecting and recording quest locations.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Minimap button, tabbed main window, clickable objective lists, and
  keybindings.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- `/cn zone`: clusters and routes everything obtainable in the current map.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Quests feed the recommendation engine; `/cn go` sets waypoints.

### Fixed

- Priority profiles applied weight names to an objective-type lookup, so
  `/cn mode fastest` did nothing.
- Objectives with no known location paid no travel cost and structurally
  outranked located ones.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Reputation, Renown and Paragon tracking, scoped account-wide versus
  character-specific.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Modular rewrite with registry-based commands, events and modules.
- Source-ranked quest metadata.
- Event-driven quest discovery.
