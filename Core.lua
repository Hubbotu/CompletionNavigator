-- careful hedging was for.

--   unknown   -- not knowable, and the number is not printed at all

-- LANGUAGE COMPATIBILITY.

-- behaves differently between them is a defect waiting for a player to find,
-- and 0.43.1 shipped after exactly that happened -- see CN.Atan2 below.
--
-- The rule these enforce is simple: if a construct means two things, the
-- addon uses neither directly. It uses one of these.

-- unpack moved to table.unpack in 5.2. The game still has the global.
CN.Unpack = rawget(table, "unpack") or unpack

-- MODULO ON NEGATIVE NUMBERS.
--
-- `math.fmod` truncates toward zero and `%` floors, so they disagree in sign
-- for negative operands -- and bearings are negative half the time. 5.1 and
-- 5.4 also differ in whether math.fmod accepts floats cleanly.
--
-- This is the floored version, which is what every angle in this addon wants:
-- the result carries the sign of the divisor, so wrapping an angle into a
-- range never produces the wrong half of the circle.

-- THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
--
-- World of Warcraft runs Lua 5.1. The offline test suite runs Lua 5.4. In 5.3
-- and later, `math.atan(y, x)` is the two-argument arctangent; in 5.1 it is
-- the one-argument one and the SECOND ARGUMENT IS SILENTLY IGNORED.
--
--     Lua 5.4:  math.atan(1, 0) == 1.5707963  (90 degrees -- correct)
--     Lua 5.1:  math.atan(1, 0) == 0.7853981  (45 degrees -- atan(1))
--
-- No error. No warning. A number that looks entirely reasonable.
--
-- Every bearing this addon computed IN GAME from 0.19.0 to 0.43.0 was
-- therefore atan(dx), with the north-south component of the direction thrown
-- away -- which is why the arrow never pointed behind the player, and why
-- "it does not turn around when I walk past the destination" was reported
-- three times and "fixed" three times against a test suite where the code was
-- genuinely correct.
--
-- This is the eighth instance in this project of the same class of defect:
-- the test environment modelling the world more simply, or differently, than
-- the world. It is the worst one, because the difference was not in a stub I
-- wrote -- it was in the language itself.
--
-- Use CN.Atan2 for every bearing. Never math.atan with two arguments.
--
-- Assigned rather than wrapped: a wrapper would contain the two-argument call
-- itself, and the suite's rule against that expression is worth more than the
-- one function call it costs. Where math.atan2 exists -- the game, and every
-- Lua before 5.4 -- it is used. Where it does not, math.atan IS the
-- two-argument form, so passing both through is correct.

-- THINGS THIS ADDON ASKS THE SERVER FOR.
--
-- FOUR COPIES OF ONE PATTERN, AND THE FIRST THING TO READ THEM GOT IT WRONG.
-- 1.9.0.
--
-- Six releases found client systems this addon read and never asked for: the
-- lockout list (1.2.0), the keystone (1.3.0), the inbox and the item cache
-- (1.4.0), quest titles (1.6.0). Each fix grew the same four parts in a
-- different file -- a send, a once-per-segment latch, a forget on a loading
-- screen, and for two of them a flag saying the answer arrived.
--
-- 1.8.0 then added the first thing that reads across them, a self-test saying
-- what is still outstanding, and it asked the wrong question: it reported
-- anything not ANSWERED, rather than anything ASKED and not answered. On a
-- client with no `RequestRaidInfo` or `CheckInbox` -- nothing was asked, and
-- nothing can be -- it said "still waiting on the lockout list and your
-- mailbox" for ever. A guard whose waiting state is also its cannot state,
-- which is rule 169 wearing the other face.
--
-- So the cross-cutting half becomes a registry and the per-system half stays
-- where it belongs. Each system says how to tell whether it has been asked
-- and whether it has been answered; nothing else has to know there are four
-- of them, and the fifth is a registration rather than a fifth place to get
-- this right.
CN.serverRequests = CN.serverRequests or {}

--                answered = function() end }
--
-- `asked` must be false when the client offers no way to ask. That is the
-- distinction the defect above turned on, so it is what the field is named
-- for rather than being left to each caller's judgement.
--
-- `token` IS THE PLAYER-FACING HALF, AND IT IS SEPARATE ON PURPOSE. 1.10.0.
--
-- `label` was written for a diagnostic. Diagnostics are read by one person in
-- English and the addon's own header says so; player-facing sentences go
-- through the locale table, and every canonical key is linted for being both
-- used and translated. 1.10.0 puts these words in front of every player, so
-- promoting `label` would have moved three strings out of the locale system's
-- reach without any lint noticing -- the exact shape `Modules/Inventory.lua`
-- records and `Modules/Follow.lua` reproduced a release after citing it.
--
-- So the registration carries both: a label that may be a count and is read
-- by `/cn selftest`, and a token that is a canonical locale key. A definition
-- with no token is still valid -- the keystone is registered by nothing and a
-- future system may be diagnostic-only -- but it is invisible to the notice.

-- A FACT THE ADDON COMPUTES AND ONLY EVER SHOWS A DIAGNOSTIC IS A FACT THE
-- PRODUCT IS NOT USING. 1.10.0.
--
-- 1.9.0 built the registry above because a self-test was reporting requests as
-- unanswered that the client had never been able to send. It shipped with
-- exactly one consumer: `Modules/SelfTest.lua`. So the addon knew, precisely,
-- that the lockout list had not come back -- and the recommendation engine,
-- which ranks instances by what you are saved to, went on answering "do this
-- dungeon next" with a confident headline and a Why block, from data it could
-- have said was incomplete.
--
-- The window where that matters is small and it is the window every session
-- opens in: the seconds after a loading screen, which is when a player who
-- has just logged in types `/cn` or glances at the heads-up line. The answer
-- given there is not merely unstable -- it can be wrong. A dungeon you are
-- already saved to is a real recommendation to a client whose lockout list
-- has not arrived, and the addon silently changes its mind a second later.
--
-- Two sentences of restraint rather than a spinner: the answer is still shown,
-- because an addon that shows nothing for four seconds after every loading
-- screen is worse than one that shows a caveat. What changes is that it stops
-- claiming more than it knows.
