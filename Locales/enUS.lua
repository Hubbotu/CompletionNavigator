-- Locales/enUS.lua
-- The canonical key list.
--
-- English needs no translation table -- the keys are English. This file exists
-- so that there is one authoritative list of every key the addon uses, which
-- `cn.ps1 check` lints every locale file against. A translator working from a
-- key that no longer exists is translating something no player will ever see.
--
-- Add a key here in the same commit that introduces it, or the lint fails.

    "Destination",
    "distance unknown",
    "no position",
    "another zone",
    "Arrived: %s",
    "Now heading to: %s",

    -- Added in 0.43.0. Chosen by where a player's eye actually lands: the
    -- arrow, the heads-up line, and the words the route says as it advances.
    "ahead",
    "veer",
    "turn",
    "back",
    "nothing actionable",

    -- Added in 0.65.0. This sentence was doing two jobs -- three places
    -- branched on it as a token while three others printed it -- so it is a
    -- token now and this is the sentence.
    "account-wide",
    "Stop cleared",
    "Stop %d of %d cleared",
    "Route complete.",

    -- 0.78.0. Two sentences that were assembled from a translated fragment
    -- and an English literal, so a German client read a translated headline
    -- followed by untranslated prose -- the pattern `Modules/Inventory.lua`
    -- records as a defect and `Modules/Follow.lua` reproduced one release
    -- after citing it.
    "All %d stops done.",
    "All 1 stop done.",
    "stop %d of %d",
    "estimated",
    "unknown",
    "solo",
    "dead",
    "grouped",
    "instanced",

    -- Added in 0.45.0 as "the words on the newest surfaces" -- and thirteen
    -- of them were never looked up by anything. They were translated into
    -- ten languages, passed every lint, and appeared on no screen.
    --
    -- Removed in 0.52.0 rather than kept: a canonical list is the addon's
    -- claim about what has been translated, and a key nothing displays makes
    -- that claim false in the direction that matters -- it says the work is
    -- done. The build now fails on a key with no call site, so the list
    -- cannot drift this way again.
    --
    -- "ready" and "another zone" were listed a second time here in 0.45.0.
    -- A duplicate in the canonical list is not harmless: this file is the one
    -- authoritative answer to "which strings does the addon use", the lint
    -- counts it, and 48 entries describing 46 strings makes every coverage
    -- number it reports wrong. Removed in 0.48.1, and the lint now refuses a
    -- list that repeats itself.
    "%d more",
    "Nothing is on a clock right now.",

    -- 1.10.0. The addon has known since 1.9.0 which of its requests to the
    -- server had not come back; until now it only told a self-test. These are
    -- the words it says instead of presenting an answer built from data it
    -- knows is incomplete.
    --
    -- The two nouns are TOKENS on the server-request registrations, not the
    -- labels beside them. Not every registration has one: quest titles are
    -- registered, are reported by `/cn selftest`, and are deliberately absent
    -- here, because an outstanding title changes what a row is called and not
    -- which row is on top.

-- REACHED THROUGH A VARIABLE, NOT A LITERAL.
--
-- The build fails on a canonical key that nothing looks up, which is how
-- thirteen keys translated into ten languages were found to appear on no
-- screen at all. Two lookups are legitimately dynamic, and this is where
-- they are declared -- with the site named, so the claim can be checked by a
-- reader as well as by the build.
